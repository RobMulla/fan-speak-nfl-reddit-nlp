Sporting events evoke strong reactions among fans and thus provide a rich exploration of emotive language. The rising popularity of online message boards and increased availability of computational tools provide new ways to examine emotive language during game play. This paper provides an analysis of the language used in comments posted to Reddit, a community determined online content aggregator, by fans during American NFL football games in 2017. We explore different computational methods to better understand the language used in this corpus.
