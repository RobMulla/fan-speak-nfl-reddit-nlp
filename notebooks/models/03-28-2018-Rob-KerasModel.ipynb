At the election of the opponent, a period may be extended for one untimed down, if any of\\nthe following occurs during a down during which time in the period expires:\\n(a) If there is a live-ball foul by the defensive team that is accepted, the offensive team may choose to extend the period by\\nan untimed down after enforcement of the penalty. If the first or third period is not so extended, any accepted penalty is\\nenforced before the start of the succeeding period.\\n(b) If there is a foul by the offense, there shall be no extension of the period. If the foul occurs on the last play of the half, a\\nscore by the offense is not counted. However, the period may be extended for an untimed down, upon the request of the\\ndefense, if the offensive team’s foul is for:\\n(1) illegal touching of a kick;\\nNote: The period may also be extended for a “first touching” violation.\\n(2) fair-catch interference;\\n(3) a palpably unfair act;\\n(4) a personal foul or unsportsmanlike conduct foul committed prior to a safety, an interception of a forward pass, the\\nrecovery of a backward pass or fumble, or the offensive team failing to reach the line to gain on fourth down; or\\n(5) a foul by the kicking team prior to a player of the receiving team securing possession of the ball during a down in\\nwhich there is a safety kick, a scrimmage kick, or a free kick.\\n(c) If a touchdown is made on the last play of a period, the Try attempt shall be made (except during a sudden-death period).\\n(d) If no fair-catch signal is given and the kickers interfere with the receiver’s opportunity to catch a kick, the receiving team\\nmay extend the period by a down from scrimmage.\\n(e) If a fair-catch is signaled and made, the receivers may choose to extend the period by a fair-catch kick down (10-2-4-a). If\\nthe first or third period is not so extended, the receivers may start the succeeding period by either a down from scrimmage\\nor fair-catch kick (11-4-3).\\n(f) If a fair catch is signaled and the kickers interfere with a receiver’s opportunity to catch a kick, the receiving team may\\nextend the period by either a down from scrimmage or a fair-catch kick (10-2-4-a).\\n(g) If a safety results from a foul during the last play of a half, the score counts. A safety kick is made if requested by the\\nreceivers.\\n16 Rule 4, Section 7\\n(h) If a double foul occurs during the last down of either half, the period shall be extended by an untimed down.\\nExceptions: The half is not extended if:\\n(1) both fouls are dead-ball fouls\\n(2) there is a major-minor double foul (“5 vs. 15”), and the major foul is by the offense, or if the major foul is a dead ball\\nfoul by the defense (see 14-5-1-Item 1.)\\nNote: Dead ball, personal, unsportsmanlike conduct, or taunting fouls by either team at the end of a half are enforced\\non the ensuing kickoff (14-4-9-Exc. 1).\\n(3) there is a double foul with a change of possession (“clean hands” rule, see 14-5-2) that does not involve a replay of\\nthe down.
