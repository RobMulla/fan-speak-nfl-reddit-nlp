Go Patriots!

Leggo.

UGHHHHHHHH IM NERVEOUS
Lets goooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!
One Steeler is playing today
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

This is going to be a really high quality game, I'm excited.
only if Gisele is involved

The Ramsey thing is a major nothing-burger.  Like he said, Jalen was voicing out a sentiment that very many (at least) professional athletes have coming into any game.

"Sorry we will not be upgraded today...

it is acceptable if you are an underdog, it is being arrogant if you are a favorite, especially if you have a history of success
"Conventional wisdom has a way of never really being ""wrong"".

Consider that the narrative after JAX-PIT wasn't ""hey, maybe we're wrong about the Jags.""  It was ""LOL, the Steelers choked against the *Jags*!""."
That comment and flair.
probably to suit the people on the West Coast who are 3 hours behind
No glove, no problem I always say.
"More important than Brady's paper cut on his hand, or Coughlin's overrated masterminding of this Jags team, is LaAdrian Waddle's placement on our inactive list. 

Starting Cameron Fleming at RT against ""Sacksonville"" is a great start to the day..."

Well it worked I'll tell you that

May the game be great and the game thread be peaceful.   Amen. 
We appreciate the kind words. Go Pats!
Um. So Dwayne Johnson flies an A-10 vs. a giant flying wolf.
You gonna take our DC and then do us like this?
I heard he is good in practice, letâ€™s see how he handles a big game. 
This is going to be such a great practice game for the Super Bowl. We need experience facing tough defenses.
Speak for yourself
pft we all know CT is not on our side..
">and the game thread be peaceful. 

Lol, good one. "
We're gonna win it for Millie!!
Let's gooooooooooooo! #Patriots

And he is a monkey trainer and just happens to know how to fly it. Movie looks so dumb based off video game with 0 story of just giant monsters destroying a city as fast as possible
parts of Michigan and Cali should be red tbh.
I'm amazed at how many people are still counting the Jaguars out after they beat the Steelers in Pittsburgh. That defence is scary, they have one of the best young RBs in the league, and Bortles is a mobile QB which we seem to struggle against. Playoffs are a whole new season where anyone can win. Remember the 2011 Giants who went into the post season with a 9-7 record? 
Surely you mean 15 hundred?
Challenge accepted.

That defense just gave up 42 points
Remember when the 49ers put 40+ points on this legendary jags defense?
10 sounds better to me
Two men have survived a sinking ship. One looks on in horror as a shark swims up to his friend. The shark takes a sniff, recoils in disgust, and swims quickly away. Incredulous, the first guy asks what just happened. The man refused by the shark shrugs, reveals that he has "Jaguars 2017 AFC Champions" tattooed on his chest, and says to his friend, "Not even a shark could swallow that."
This might be the nicest thing anyone has said about Jim Rome
LETS GO
Could be a Tampa Bay Lightning fan...
"As long as the Patriots actually show up in the first quarter unlike the Steelers I think theyll be fine.

The quick 21-0 hole the Steelers dug themselves into let the Jaguars control the pace of the rest of the game"

I am just ready for the game to begin."
great name though
Good god, man! I only have like 20 beers!
Like has he seen a Patriots game thread?
Lol. I bet it still tastes like piss
I am praying to super natural being/s night as well reach. 
This is true. Although Kraft is a heavily underrated sneakerhead.
It would have been more believable if you kept them both low scoring. Pats have had one of the better defenses in the league lately. 
As a New England fan living in CT and moving to Jacksonville next year, someone tell me how to feel....
GL Jaguars fans.  Let's Go!!!
But I have work tomorrow!
Bold.
I can Diggs it
I know but I doubt that will happen twice in a row. Plus if they start getting to Brady, they'll gain the upper hand
"""Tony, do you think we'll ever heard the phrase 'AFC Champion Blake Bortles'?""

""Well, Jimâ€¦ with the Patriots up by 35, I don't think it's going to be this year"""
"Ramsey talking some smack to Brady before the game... all I've gotta say is you better bring it today, Jalen. 

This dude clowns the Steelers last week for taking their eyes off the prize and Jalen acting like he already bought his plane ticket to Minneapolis and booked a spa day"
What's the over under on the amount of time it will take before people start crying about the refs?
Rack him.
Don't you want the 49ers QB to get a Super Bowl ring?
I think your rule would be simpler if it was just root against the Pats.
What about if they win?
Blake Bortles looks older than Tom Brady.
We can only hope...
Four plays.
Brady with 27 yards rushing is the most unrealistic thing in that box score IMO.
Some of us are.
yo, thank you for posting this. This was actually really really well made. 
Accurate 
His legacy was cemented after a game you'd rather me not mention, imo.
Philip Dorsett game
The London games have really helped them there. Being able to see the same team here multiple times meant that they became a good choice for people looking for a team.
Animals get big, wreck shit, the Rock beats them with the help of his giant Ape friend.
They don't want that energy 
(Of course, that it was shows how silly QB Winz and Ringz arguments are, since it was due to a play he wasn't on the field for.)
Lol Phil Simms.
Yes
Nervous as a motherfucker. Let's go Pats! Woot!
God yes
"Brady used Gronk!

It's super effective! 

Enamy Bortles fainted! "
I'm kinda nervous but I'm cool with it. Jags are really good. But after all I rather lose to the Jags than some other teams.
Welcome to the annual Brady bowl folks
and...you prove my point.
Let's get this out of the way now, you little shit. You know God damn good and well what a computer is!
I bet Brady uses lots of moisturizer. 
Ahh, great odds!
Those searsucker pants were fire tho

Well yeah would have to compare it to a game 7 of other sports where nfl is still top imo
Like how you guys took over the league when you ended Marino's career? 
Jags aren't winning, but it's great to see have a franchise have hope
Josie's on a vacation far away...
You could set the o/u at 0.5 and I'd still take the under.
At first I was like, this is a really long commercial.
And the Jags will also have no chance to ever win the SB, of course.
Wouldn't it be better if the Vikings beat the Patriots in Minnesota?
taking under
"Gentlemen I had a prophetic dream about this game Friday night in which I watched the highlights:

* Fournette will be stuffed on the 1 yard line early on and Jags will fail to score on 4th down

* Mercedes Lewis will score a 15yd TD in the 4th quarter after the LB covering him slips and falls, which will scare us a bit but the Pats will seal it away narrowly with a W."
plot twist: it is

That's some good shit right there.
Noles aren't good enough for this squad. 
Malkovich is the man
Underdogs bro
If we're being honest, this final four was the best possible scenario for the Patriots
LETS. FUCKING. GO.
FUCK YES
i like how that is filmed at the New England Conservatory
That was a good promo.
That was a great promo. Wagner just geysered cum out of his grave.
Eagle fans need a meme to compensate for lack of rings
I love this promo
Love Malkovich but this is really fucking stupid. 
I think it's something to do with them being underdogs last weekend
yea, thats probably it
That Promo was fucking amazing
I might die
underdog since everyone called the eagles a one and done team when wentz got injured
k...we need that every week, but John needs to stay in character.  His rage monster gets me fired up.
Holy fuck that promo got me feelin some type o' way
This is a great ad, love it!
Atta boy, way to have faith in your team. 
That was an incredible hype video
We want Simms! We want Simms! We want Simms! We want phil Simms!
Do you know de wae
No love
Wow that commercial hyped me up. I got goosebumps
Go Goliath #12!
LETS GO PATS!
I'm so happy we can play the Jags. When they won against the Steelers, I was so excited
"GOOSEBUMPS.

AMAZING COMMERCIAL!! 

"
John Malkovich hype man! 
I really hope for a nice, clean game, with no screw ups from the refs, so that we can all focus on the good football this afternoon
">nobody expected Jacksonville  

Jason Mendoza would like a word, Tony"
Milk it
Is there Malkovich bandwagon flair available?
Thats an amazing commercial tbh
That "teaser" was gold.
Dunno why giants hate us lol. 
I am stoked. 3 simple words: LETS GO PATS
"â€œ15 rounderâ€

Tony Romo already jinxed the Jags."
Just got here, is this thread a shit show yet?
Hahahah, "GET THE CAMERA OFF THE FUCKING FIELD"
"We got a Brady lip read f bomb during the pregame.

Lol."
Angry Brady is best Brady
5 minutes to go!
LET'S GO!!!

Hmmm ... what do they have in common?

Looks like Tom just kindly ask the camera man to get off the field.
i rooted for you
Lol Brady just said "get off the fucking field" to the camera guy
Sock aint gonna move itself.
Is "Jagwire" the correct pronunciation?  If not, can people please, please stop using it?  It's annoying to a very extreme extent.
I see a Good Place reference, and I upvote. What a great show.
This will surely be a nice little thread with no overwhelmingly one-sided fan-favourite team out of the two :) 
That tease... I'm hyped. Let's go!
Never! 
Bengals-Steelers concussion game is still tops for me
I am with you today Viking brother. We will win.
They were in his way.. seriously nothing to see here but blatant obsession with Brady
Something "off the fucking field" 
"Tony~~â€™s hair~~ is perfect."
"\>Ramsay highlights

> beat by AJ in first clip

>penalty on second clip"
It bothers me when Romo pronounces it jag-wires.  I understand Brits pronounce in Jag-you-ars.  But jag-wires just bothers me.
"Comparing covering Gronk to AJ Green. lol

6'6"" 265 lbs

6'4"" 208 lbs

Said no one ever 
I really liked that Malkovich intro. I kinda wish he'd put on a Brady jersey and say "I will splash de glove in my own house" but the orchestra thing was sick.
Going to be a tough game. Go pats!
It is in the U.S.
"heh

https://imgur.com/ZaLaxNP"
Why don't people want the Patriots to win? Don't people want to watch sustained greatness, and watch Brady win his 6th ring? People rooted for MJ in his prime
It's okay. We trust our overlords. 
Can confirm: am evil. 
"More F bombs. Brady's been dropping a ton.

All the hosts of the NFL Network's show this morning were creaming themselves at Tom Brady's ungloved hand. It was ridiculous.

I came here to win a championship and shit post and I am almost out of shit posts.
DAE KNEELING
Good Luck Jags Bro's, hopefully we can keep it civil with the rest of the NFL with us, but the shit show that was last week I can only hope
agreed...everyone thinks we have no respect for jax. This game is gonna be TOUGH!
Scar legit looks like Tom's grandpa
Of course they have a chance.. just not a large one
Philip fucking Phillips 
Oh hey we're doing the anthem again?
Ummm....I rooted against MJ with a passion. You got revisionist history.
Hereâ€™s to an exciting, injury-free game for all. Go Pats!
American Idol is still a thing?
Assuming things stay as they are, he will be next year.
the fuck is this shit 
Who names their kid Philip Phillips?
Bold prediction Tj Yeldon will run for more yards than Maurice Jones Drew today 
Come on man Phillip Phillips?  Is that even a real name? 
why the fuck do they always mention which record company the anthem singers are signed with? 
your name is Phillip Phillips? your parents suck
What are you doing with that guitar
There will be 40k by the end
"Brandon Spikes was a pretty solid part of our defense there for a while.

I like our Rutgers and Arkansas connections though."
I think it's just because this is the farthest they've made it, and this is our 7th afccg in a row.
Philip Phillips?  Could his parents not remember more than one name?
Pretty weak singing. 
This singer is horrible.
Who the hell names their kid Phillip with the last name Phillips? 
"The following contest is set for one-fall, and is for the AFC Championship!

Introducing first, the challenger, weighing in with an AFC South title and a 10-6 record, the Jacksonville Jaguars!


And second, weighing in with a 13-3 record, the reigning, defending, undisputed, NFL heavyweight champion of the woooooorld, the New England Patriots!"
WE ARE THE TERROR!!!
Not a fan of this rendition
This guy is ATROCIOUS 
Being whiney

Why bother with the guitar?
I am so fucking pumped holy jezus
Very folksy National Anthem
This anthem is weak
This... is painful to listen to.
Put me on a watch list then brother!
">Phillip Phillips

Is this even a real person"
It's not over...
Well this anthem is pretty horrid. 
but I'm a **Patriot** fan.
Lol, right?
Oh no baby what is you doin
Gronk making up his own lyrics
Solid 6/10 anthem. Definitely heard worse
@ /u/Riteblockchain
This guys parents were asshole, how do you name someone Phillip Phillips....
Look at Major Major Major Major out here with his guitar
OH BABY IM READY
Why is the guitar necessary
What if his middle name is fucking?
Is this the Starbucks acoustic version of the anthem? 
Hand comment drink.
Iâ€™m ready for some controversial penalties and catches
Sooo flat. 
Philip isn't very good
Theres a little too much avocado in this anthem
This sounds like something that would be in a lame Coke commercial 
The guitar is so distracting during this anthem.
because if you have never heard of the guy, you need to know that someone somewhere thought he was good enough to sign to a contract
He's actually Philip Phillips the III, son to Philip Phillips II and Philippina Phillips
The Legend Phillip Phillips
Is it just me? or is he flat the whole time?
One man's terrorists are another's Patriots.  
Who the fuck names their kid "Phillip Phillips"?
Glad he had the guitar so he could make it sound like a shitty indie song.
He's a good singer, but the guitar stuff was just freakin weird.
What kind of a name is Philip Philips
We always get some bad national anthems in new england
Damn it Phil.  Good luck to you eagle bro. Hope to see you in 2 weeks
I gotta say, him strumming that one string is really adding a lot to this vocal performance
"""Congratulations Mr. And Mrs. Phillips, it's a boy! Have you picked a name?""
""We have one in mind..."""
That was a fucking terrible national anthem
Michael, I didnâ€™t know you were a patriots fan.
he butchered that anthem.  He was flat the whole time.
"His parents saw the opportunity and took it.

Phillip Phillips."
My point was they obviously would have to double gronk with Ramsey.
If you have Verizon I think you can stream the game through the NFL app for free. 
Brady is SO pissed off.
I thought the anthem was okay. why are people so down on it?
What is this anthem right now
Yes
I'm ready to spend the next three hours mostly complaining about too many stupid commercials
https://youtu.be/N1Wrx6eQZ1E
Yup it was terrible.
Phillip on deez nuts
LMAO gronk looks mildly confused
Nah, some irrelevant dude who won American Idol years ago. I only know because I googled.
The heart of his enemies.
"Because the guitar sounds like random strumming and has nothing to do with the poem.

He sounds like he's just noodling."
Better than the five minutes of hyper vibrato we usually get.
We do, actually. 
Absolutely! Jacksonville is an amazing team and they are gonna give us a run today
Lol, I'm surprised he managed to win American Idol. That was so meh
Does Belichick have a heart?
This first drive by New England is gonna be so crucial.
Yes
Thatâ€™s what she said... wait
Anything can happen. We are always nervous. 
"https://youtu.be/yB3dZQW5vGw

Now that kind of "performance" is worth boycotting over.

What's going on in Africa?
Iâ€™m so excited right now
I sure do.
looks like a fish lmao
John Malcovich start:  Amazing, CBS please more of those
He was flat.  a not or two below actual key almost the whole time...especially on the high notes.
bad for the jaguars, great for the patriots. pissed brady is best brady
Just really boring with no passion.
Why would anyone do that to a child
Agreed. I liked it 
His name is Phillip Phillips, Jr which means his dad is also Phillip Phillips
speed up boy
It's irresponsible of the Patriots organization to have Phillip Phillips sing the national anthem.  Hypothermia is a real risk when you're panties are soaked. 
[REEEEEEEE](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/830/b49.gif)
Alright, checking in from the UK! Just got finished cooking dinner and sitting down! LET'S GOOOOOOO!
Mr. and Mrs. Phillips
what a whiny rendition, with a guitar melody that didn't even fit. and he was off-key at the best parts of the song, to boot. that was horrible.
he doesn't seem like the type to make excuses.
That national anthem was straight up ass. That was the worst thing Iâ€™ve ever heard
Lol so wishing someone purposefully gets hurt is ok? Got it. #FloodGate
It was all bad. 
INB4 FOG
I think flyovers stopped a few years ago
This has been a great production so far, I am AMPED
Man this thread is ready to blow I can just feel it.
Foggier than Daredevil.
Probably better than that trash. 
LET'S GOOOOOO
Maybe an unpopular opinion: I didn't mind the anthem - at least he didn't stretch the words out until they become unrecognizable.
Thats the first time a national anthem redemption has put me to sleep
MY NERVOUS WHAT?
Contractual obligation
I made sure my pretzels were unsalted. This should be good.
Oh shit that's today? I thought that was tomorrow
Here we go! 
DAMN THATS $100k.... Wait now its $25, oh nope, now its $4mil
Maybe both?
Fuck me! I just saw John Malkovich's AFC final commercial. It was brilliant!
he doesn't have a heart

Too easy
Lol
COOOOOKS! 
FUCK YOU BITCHES!!!!
Yup, hand looks fine. 
Hand reference coming after that pass.
Shouldn't the question be, how bad was the competition if that guy won?
Lets gooooo
Fuck yea
Hand looking ok
Picking up where big Ben left off. 
Cookin Ramseyâ€™s already 
Good protection!
Accuracy doesn't seem to be an issue!!!  YAY!!!
WHAT HAND INJURY
the forbidden fruit 
If Pats win the SB this year, Brady will have more postseason wins than any other QB has games. 2nd is Peyton at 27 with 14-13 record. The only other players with 28+ games are Rice and Vinatieri.
Holy shit if cooks can get that open on you.. you suck
Brady is the goat
WHAT HAND INJURY??
Nothing wrong with that hand 
#HAVENT PLAYED A CB LIKE ME

*well he came early Jim. That is really poor planning and preparation. I think we are all disappointed with this performance. A lot of us had been looking forward to it*
Or just overblown by the media

Jags can't get to the quarterback when he has lightning speed
1006 total career rushing yards for Brady.  Look at that leopard speed
Ha. Running joke
Brady is the leading rusher for the Pats right now.
Is everyone getting a bad frame rate or is it just me?
\#ButHisThumb! :D
LET'S GOOOO
My heart is about to explode
Handgate
The gazelle
Some serious Peyton Manning speed.
He only ran for a yard, maybe his mobility is stiffened.  
Brady went out of bounds, why did the clock not stop?
The GOAT scampers uphill.
That was epic.  Maybe just wait for a bit till it's uploaded on YouTube.
damn, nice tackle by Jack there. burkhead had a lot of space in front of him if jack didn't make that stop.
the anti Arthur Blank
Go for it
I never know who will be commentating the games because I usually turn them on right before it starts. I love seeing it's Romo though.  It makes it a lot more enjoyable to listen to.
Already picking on jalen Ramsey â€œgonna win that bitchâ€ huh?
Brady ran for one, but that's how the Jags are going to have to beat Brady: rush four, get pressure, no breakdowns in the secondary. 
Jaylen baby what is u doing
Cooks ran a 4.33 you idiot
4th down lets goooo!
Going for it!
gg guys game over, 1 yard rush
running back brady
Oooh, we're going for it.
niceee
Yes.  We are using Lewis with Burkhead or White in our 21 set.  I was hoping we would do this.
Great tackle by Ramsey
MY HEART IS FUCKIN RACING
Oh please Ramsey keep talking and take a penalty 
risky
Let's go
Ramsey shit talking after giving up 2 catches already lol
Ramsey can't keep quiet.
Why's Ramsey talking like he didn't just get the tackle because of a high throw
Canâ€™t wait to see Ramsey get exposed 
"â€œOMG BrADyâ€™s ruinEd!â€

Heâ€™s throwing well so far."
No! Go for the FG
that was a bad float pass on 3rd down by Brady
Ramsey is such a fucking squid
Not a fan of using the timeout there.
Man the jags defense is garbage
Really interesting early snaps. 21 personnel every snap so far
I don't think I've ever seen a second-year player who is cockier than Ramsey. The dude never shuts up. 
Gotta keep himself hyped up. 
Both these teams play the most badass style of football.
I don't like this decision.
Ok good.. just kick it. Jax can't come back from a 3 point deficit
Good on you! Best of luck!
Still going for it, wow
That was a wasted time-out if we were just trying to draw them offsides.
Wait, timeout, THEN still going for it??
He wasn't set yet.
Heâ€™s hateable. Thereâ€™s nothing to like 
Already trying to make big dick play calls seems like the pats have the ass today. 
He does doesn't he.  He sounds handsome, he looks handsome.
DOLA
'Dola!
oh yeah
holy shit that pass was gorgeous. 
odd to not take the points 
YEA!!!
Clutchdola
Good god
AMEN DOLLA DOLLA BILL$, Y'ALL!
DOLA is most clutch player in the league(after Brady).
DOLLA
Hell yeah! That a perfect throw from Brady
Well they just died apparently
what a throw!!
I love you danny!!!
DANNY

Lmao 
Jags D what?
Fuck you jalen
That was pretty
Danny "playoff" Amendola!!!
Danny 'CLUTCH' Dola
DOLA!
Brady's hand isn't a problem
what a play!!!
What a beautiful pass
Fuck that was sexy.
Yeah that hand looks fine lol
You clearly have no idea how illegal motion works.
That's one way to show disrespect for the best D in the league. 
Amendola so clutch
Danny "Secret Weapon" Amendola.
Hands fine :)
Right on the money 
Wow, that lob, dropping it in the fucking bucket
KEEP PICKING ON THE LINEBACKERS 
Ramsey can holler all he wants, Dola with the first!!!
It's ALWAYS Dola
Telvin Smith is getting torched
Oh Danny boy!
Need a first? Throw it to Danny.
You did good. That's for sure.
You see Belichick freaking out. So much emotion in his face
"""are you the secret weapon against Jacksonville?""

""that's a secret"" "
Danny Always There When You Need Him
DOLA
The Jacksonville â€œThereâ€™s no response to our secondaryâ€ Jaguars
Amendola has the best hands in the NFL. Fight me.
Brady too good
Amen clutch
The Dola DIme.
Liking the early 4th down try
No no no no why why why why why ...yes yes yes yes
This is feeling like a rocking chair game, as it's begun.
Tommy is breaking the consecutive completion record 
Hi, welcome to the NFL 
GASSED UP
This is gunna get ugly 
best passing offense in the league. jags gotta make adjustments to stay in this
He looks like Stan from American dad
GOAT 
Stop with the cute plays Josh
Ya because heâ€™s a fucking man
I was told the Jags didn't need to do that 
"Bullshit his knee didn't touch

Disregard, saw replay"
YESSS
That was gorgeous 
You clearly haven't watched him. He cannot get open. No matter the DB he can't get open on man coverage 
Every pass over 5 yards is working keep doing that lol
"Stop.

Saying.

Jag-wires"
AMEN-dola, Amen!
Lmao. No. 
exactly
Nice open field by Smith.  We need our RBs to make the first guy miss.
Big 3rd and goal here. If early momentum swings Patriots way, there will be no turning back.
Official on the money with that call, lets keep it that way :)
pretty clearly did
Its the first drive lol
Ramsey seems so determined to have something to talk shit about. Team disrespecting you? Check. Team respecting you? Check. You allowed two catches already? Check.
Your defense is legit
Really impressed by the Jags tackling. Almost no YAC
My bortles is maximum low. ã¤à¼½ â—•â€¾â—• ã¤ à¼¼ ã¤à¼½ â—•â€¾â—• ã¤ à¼¼   ã¤à¼½ â—•â€¾â—• ã¤ à¼¼
Telvin is getting mismatched. Not something I like to see. Lowndes county boy there. 
Well not a bad start. 6/6 57 yards. Thumb looks great. 
I donâ€™t get the playcalling when the long passes are working.
Wahhhhh
Good game Jags!
Let's go! 
Fleming barely touched him. I miss Cannon.
Pats victimizing telvin smith 
Just rewind your DVR
Come on o-line...
flemming is going to hurt us isn't he 
"à¼¼ ã¤ â—•_â—• à¼½ã¤ GHOST TAKE MY ENERGY à¼¼ ã¤ â—•_â—• à¼½ã¤

Jags over under 4 sacks today
Cool
Thanks Fleming /s
I'll take that opening drive
Knife t have some points up
Brady looks fine
My bortle is low. ã¤à¼½ â—•â€¾â—• ã¤ à¼¼ ã¤à¼½ â—•â€¾â—• ã¤ à¼¼ ã¤à¼½ â—•â€¾â—• ã¤ à¼¼
Terrible red zone playcalling
Damn Gronk was open when he cut right if Brady had another second
Solid drive
Game over boys! Book the hotels
I'll never understand why people were underestimating the Jags. Their D is really scary
Good drive . Brady looks great. 
damn. these fools are fresh right now
Jax D is Fast AF
This defense isn't bad at all.
solid ass first drive moved the chains pretty well. ill take it
Now the real battle. Bortles Vs. Defense 
Good hold from the Jags D there.
Me too, but for different reasons
Good 3 for the Pats. Good hold for the Jags. 
So 90s it hurts.
RIP
League MVPâ€™s do not normally retire. 
Time to see what Bortles boy got in that arm on the big stage
Ramsey talks trash after getting roasted by Cooks 
This is where the game matters. Our D needs to force turnovers and maybe even scoring turnovers 
I like this. 
Shut up Gregg 
 M U H H A N D
Good to get points, but those red zone opportunities are precious against this defense.
THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS WILL NEVER LOSE ANOTHER GAME AGAIN
Jags defense looking FAST. They're closing in on everything and not missing tackles.
It's not jagwires, Tony. It's Jagwahz.
Auto complete, and trying to watch the game at the same time.  Try being nicer to people on the internet, your comments are a reflection of your character. 
I know this is unpopular but I'll be happy when we get a new offensive coordinator who is less predictable.
Nah son, you work remotely!
Hopefully nobody is playing a drinking game where you need to take shot everytime Romo says "I'm telling ya"
28-3
good eye from the ref on the knee there
He should just take the sack? 
"Two things:

Cam Fleming could be an issue, let's work on that.

All of these short passes behind the line to Lewis are 100% being done to set up a dagger behind these LBs. "
That play call on 1st and goal was FUCKING garbage.... Fake screen in to real screen... Come on, it killed that great opening drive.
Letâ€™s go D
Huh?
Bortles will throw a pick on his 3rd passing attempt. 
Considering every Super Bowl Brady has been in has been decided by 6 or less points Iâ€™d say it will probably be exciting 
The salty Jaguars fans are out in droves today. Any negative Jaguars comment is getting downvotes to hell.
What? You guys are already crying?
Yeah I saw it on the replay
Love when people think the refs only job is to help the Patriots
Tom with dem killer eyes
Holy fuck the salt level in your post is real.  You CAN pick within a yard of the line of scrimmage and if its close it is usually not called.  Stop being salty as fuckkkkk
Yep pass to Dola for 21
Idk man the Yankees are becoming the Yankees again.
Iâ€™m dying at that comment
lol wtf? that's some serious effort hating right there bro
Now for the other half of the matchup hardly anyone talked about.  Jax offense vs NE defense.  Pretty excited to see how Jax attacks our defense.  I am still expecting a lot of Fournette and play-action early.
i always imagine if we had drafted brown instead
1 play, long way to go.
I can't believe we are playing the jaguars. Good for them. Wow.
I feel like both sides are happy with the 1st drive
I mean, I totally get not wanting NE in the Super Bowl, but when was the last NE SB that wasn't exciting in some way?
so? its the first drive. 2 sick throws are a goos sign on the first drive lol
Or every time they zoom in on Brady's hand
Great observation
I'm surprised Ramsey didn't run over to shit talk Gostkowski after that field goal. 
A 1 yard sack. 
That is formula.  Hopefully the OL does well,  and the check downs aren't covered so well.  
So did the Falcons D until the 2nd half 
The screwdriver guys?
"Media played themselves. Cut his thumb, got stitches, didn't throw for two days.

Patriots say very little, media can't help but invent a story where they aren't handed one. Only thing that should have been written is: ""Brady misses second consecutive practice with hand injury"".

That was the whole story."
People complain about the No Fun League but then whine when players get hyped and talk trash
Lol
Cameron Fleming is trash. Brady's injury got all the attention, but LaAdrian Waddle's is the most costly one for us.
Good first drive. That sack was worrying, Jax is very very fast. Think we are going to have to keep moving people around and creating mismatches to move the ball.
Ugh. Field goals are so bad for momentum
I feel like the Pats give up sacks in the red zone a lot...
Case in Point
I find it has a striking similarity to your own team's logo, actually. Did you find the Vikings logo  as ugly?
The Pats puts on entertaining SBs. Having a weaker narrative doesn't mean the games themselves are bad.
don't wanna risk an interception there I'm guessing 
Lewis has been pretty amazing this season
Except the 2 times he did
At least what? WE HAVE TO KNOW
What?
Probably making sure the tape doesn't get caught and messed up
Yea but Jaylen tho
I blame Phillip Phillipsâ€™s parents
Our defense is going to start slow on this drive like always and the next quarter it will be a tough defense to score on. calling it. 
https://i.imgur.com/Ed4LdEW.jpg
Kind of a disappointing drive. Pressure was good by Jacksonville, but more importantly they were swarming on those short passes to the running backs: something I was kind of hoping to be the weakest link. I'll take the points but still.
my heart is fucking cracking my ribs right now
>Bottles
Why?  Moving the ball well and getting points even if only 3 is good.
Phil squared
"I'll take the over in the loss.
"
Against a top D?  No. 
Phillips is a first name?
Yep. They went for it, Brady hit Amendola on a wheel for 20 yards.
6-6 in first drive with some nice touch passes
Bortles just doesnâ€™t impress me
That's because your Era is starting up. Carson Wentz is the real deal
SWAT looks boring AF
Jaguars LMAO
Looks like we're letting the Jags know that we can pass the ball on the 1st drive. 2nd drive will be more run focused I assume
Fuck off, they earned their way here
And chiefs hashtag should be "not one" for every playoff win
Figured as much, but a few other people in the thread belong on that same bus
He has stitches in his hand, pretty sure it was not a smokescreen...
I can't picture a scenario where being a Browns fan is entertaining if it involves football.  So to each his own. 
Gronk needs to throw him out of the club.
The love everyone has for the underdog in this thread is incredible 
And yet he can throw a 30 yard dart and a 25 yard tear drop
Hardly saw any of that
I think Jags best choice will be play action against the Pats. Here's hoping for just handoffs down the middle though
I think in maybe 5-10 years time 
Is SWAT good?
Gronk was held there hard
"Ahh yes the old put a bunch of stitches in your QB's throwing hand for the fun of it ruse.  Classic.

If there wasn't a problem, Brady would be under center, not taking every snap from the gun."
Great first drive, they learned how they will play different match ups, Lewis behind the line isn't going to work, and still got 3.
I want to live bud. 
Technically he only has one first name. But twice. 
Pats score 3 pts on every drive and they win.
Abortles
That's just a dumb thing to say. Sure winning brings a lot of bandwagoners, but I literally grew up 10 minutes from Bryant college and my dad would take me to training camp all the time in the 90s.
been there all season IIRC
The only player on their roster who annoys me is Ramsey. Liked Bortles for years, saw Telvin Smith play high school ball, Fournette seems like a high character player, and who couldn't love Calais Campbell? 
Why does our playcalling go to shit once we get into the red zone? 
"Shemar Moore . . . S.W.A.T.'s ultimate badass.

They never show the actual tv show, just that guy being angry"
After the Browns get good how long do you think it will take people to turn on them
"This first Jags possession is very important to see how this game is going to go.


Can they run the ball? We need to know"
you can drop the arguably.. it'll give your D more credit too
k
Bortles is thinking with portals
He probably means that we don't kill with one big play, it's death by papercuts 
You're my favorite game thread commenter.
No pressure whatsoever...
Chung got his bell rung.
Damn, DE got a hand on it too.
Hahahahaha
Pats d lookin good
If the Jags win today, I want them to win the whole thing. Blake Bortles will have a ring and no matter how much we trash his skills, heâ€™ll always have that to defend himself and brag about.
great block
Can't give him a year and a half in the pocket. 
Not really, no
I mean, Patriots needed two big plays and had to go for it on 4th down. Not exactly the easiest drive.
O-SHAG-HENNESSEY
itt: "JAX held NE to a fg? The dynasty is *over*!" 
That "endorsement" video of him or whatever you wanna call it was great
/r/nflstreams 
He almost sounds nervous
The Wikings of MN, according to The Mountain
a little early to say....you goddam idiot
2nd and 3rd and long is a very good thing, so far, for NE
That block. Nice.
Doesn't look good, their O-Line looked like a brick wall.
Hey did you guys know that Chris Hogan used to play lacrosse?
A bunch of 7s and some 9s instead of 1 10 and a bunch of 3s
I mean...they were then
Two tone helmets are ugly.
Lmao fournette is used on every fucking play so far
Fournette is the entire offense. That wont last. 
I think it's gonna be a close game either way.
"Stop jinxing us Nantz

"
Dude looks 45
Jesus water
That ankle isn't slowing him down
27 seems a little slow today. 
Van Noy not starting?  Makes me nervous. 
23 going on 45
Come on D
Block towards his own endzone on Chung?
Naw its to constantly miss tackles and pray they fall out of bounds. 
Used to be a backup in NE.
Harrison looked slow there
And our defense is still an embarrassment
I giggle every time I see the D-fence signs
So my understanding of the Jags offense so far is Bortles either hands it off to Leonard, or passes to him 
Watch out A A Ron
So far, both defenses are making both offenses earn every inch of yardage
JAX is playing dink and dunk, like NE
Jax moving the ball slowly.  Where's our fans calling the end of the dynasty
Blake GOATles. 
Looks like a grown ass 40 year old man
Oh shut the fuck up
It's not, but the Dragon Ball franchise is still gonna keep going 
We despise Dan Shaughnessy so it kind of makes sense
Ok with this, Pats keep you honest and wait for a fuck up
Lol this is hilarious. The dreaded 3.3 ypp drive
VAN NOY
Van Noy FTW
Lol what?  Jax has moved the ball 25 yards and you're already complaining.
Nice defensive play!
KYLEE
KVN!!
Damn KVN!
VAN NOY THANK U
What a play Van Noy!!!
Great play by van noy
I missed Van Noy
Now with less woman-assaulting! ^TM
"Is what every team going against the Patriots defense has said.

We defined ""bend, don't break"" this year."
Great D KVN 
Nice play van noy
Great play Van Noy!!!
 Van Noy has been a stud this year
Woah, Van Noy was beat.  Bortles underthrew
Huge fucking play 
Van Noy did something?! Yay. 
Perfect defensive play
Inches. Different game right there.
Fucking nice save
Nice D
its over dude. 
Thats a LB on  a RB!
well done
Holy shit did we just cause an incompletion? What the fuck is happening???
Who knew the Patriots D's weakness was checkdowns? Jax figured it out.
Wow! Great coverage!
THE BUTLER
Great play by van noy, looked like he was gonna get beat
THERE WE GO BABY
LETS GOOOOOO 
Nice. Now let's open this game up. 
Ez
James Corden is just the worst. 
Letsss fuckingggg goo!!!!!!
"Great play by Van Noy
"
THERE WE GO BOYS 
Or Dropsonville
Dropped passes though 
MALCOLM GO!
BUTLER
Pats D is just too gassed up!!!
Playoff hero Malcolm Butler 
Good to have van noy back
fuck that man, its the afc championship game, let that trash talk commence. 
Good start
That's what I'm talkin about!
GET FUCKED JAX GO HOME 
"Two bad throws by Bortles on that drive cost the Jags a lot of yards.

edit: lol wut? am i wrong? he underthrew the RB and he threw behind his receiver on the last throw."
Lol Jacksonville offense is so trash. Unless facing the Steelers â€œdefenseâ€ of course
Kyle. Van. Noy.
What???? That was perfect defense
Naw, just being sucky atm
Great play from Van Noy
Probably because there was no DPI lol
There we go Butler, good stop. Welcome back!
Butler on Lee!!!  Man, everything so far has been as most of us predicted.  Both teams aren't really dong anything really surprising.
Cause it wasn't dpi....? 
You'd have to be a fucking moron to think that was DPI. 
KVN!
Lamest excuse ever.
Van Noy, you weird, wonderful bastard
I feel like Bortles is scared to throw, and thatâ€™s why
The ball hit off the back of his hand..
Why no DPI? Oh yes, no DPI.
10-0 coming up 
That was pretty egregious holding at the bottom no lie
Jagwires
Doesnâ€™t feel very aggressive to me lmao
Guys. There's black tape on Brady's hand.
Literally hit the ball before the player. 
Long drive and 0 points. I like it 
Because it wasnâ€™t dpi by any form? 
Great play from Van Noy, damn
Plz
Jags unis would be so great if they just picked one color for their helmets
It bugs me more than it should that Romo and Nance are pronouncing it "Jaguires"
That was clean lol
The only other relevant team today
SO glad he's back
How on earth was that DPI?
Hand touched the mask. Didn't pull him down by the mask
Huge play by the LB. Completely different game right now if that happened.
Passes are too soft to catch in stride
Van noy has been holding our defense together. Can't wait for hightower to be back
Gotta check the GameThread.
Lol.  WTF are you watching.  Pats got the stop and they punted.
Moved from 9 to 7.5 with brady's injury
Like a goliath 
Swiggin' dat hocus pocus
Keep it civil homie
Hasn't had an incompletion yet. Threw two dimes to cooks and danny. 
Iâ€™m just hoping we donâ€™t get any questionable flags today. I donâ€™t think I can handle the toxicity again.
the Patriots defense has been amazing most of the year. now the national audience will learn this. 
if you couldn't care less then why are you even in this thread?
You're getting Patricia, it's hardly a fair trade.
">  How do people voluntarily watch this network

You mean like you're doing right now?"
:) 
I hope he keeps the beard.  
Pretty early to bail on a game
They are obviously on their phones so they can participate in this thread.
Lol that's a dome. 
:)
because of the pressure put on by Flowers. 
You guys play in a dome
Because if you watch the replay van noy hit the ball before he hit the receiver.
I actually think we are going to see a ton of very tight man and make bortles find the windows. He isn't a great tight window guy to me
Made a play on the ball tho
6/6 with 57 yards. He was also sacked once and scrambled for 1 yard.
Fine? Not noticeably affected, but only a single drive to really tell. 
No lol
Lol you don't know football
Terrible. Both have gotten better over the year with d line doing better than rush 
Cool roof bro
They're not. Our defense just showed up today
Made a couple incredible throws. Shown velocity and touch.
Not in England 
Van Noy filling in for Hightower in clutchness
Made the Jags work for those first downs. That's what we want to see.
Stepped up nicely after Hightower went on IR
Oh I guess Iâ€™m a moron
Ball hit hand first therefore no PI
You taking all your little shampoos?
Sorry I forgot, your team lost a playoff game to only field goal 18-17. I just was saying 7 points will make the opposing team reeling, 3 pts mean its a lot easier to tie
The Morse code Clay Matthews commerical is my favorite of those.  His delivery is on point
Little early to be drinking....
Same when Iâ€™ve watched nba finals games and theyâ€™re like 5 feet from the damn court.
He hit the ball first so that's fine
We tried that for the first 8 plays but decided playing defense was smarter. 
I think he hit the ball before he hit the hands. You're allowed to do that if you're going for the ball. 
Van noy finally healthy the last couple weeks
Building a lead to make Bortles *have* to beat you and let they playcalling get away from Fournette will do a lot in helping win this game. Bortles seems to throw a lot of picks when he has a higher amount of pass attempts. Great start for NE so far. 
Is it bad if I canâ€™t tell if this is a joke or not
Then why didn't you use him that way?
I think the range of motion might be limited by the tape. 
Yes. Let the hate flow through you. 
Blake Bortles sounds like a Harry Potter character
Athens ga baby! Go pats!!! 
not even sneaky if you followed the pats. Defense was significantly better with him just on the field. Really stepped up and leads the D. Green Dot, always around the ball, really underappreciated i think
Itâ€™s so obnoxious 
Gillette wasnâ€™t built to hold in crowd noise  acoustics 
I miss craig ferguson
Da 45 pts high power offense
Anyone sensing a pick 6?
Perfect. Let the hate consume you. 
Acoustically Gillette is poorly designed. Tough to get real loud
Not that there's anything wrong with that
That Pats first drive wasn't that easy. This one will set the tone for the rest of the game
I think the thing that pisses me off the most about that commercial is that computers are in almost everything now
Ugh the stress
Reactionary lol...... hey are the best coaches team in the league.  
It didn't against Tennessee. As long as the offense keeps up 5 minute plus drives the defense will continue to be rested.
Lmk when the dolphins actually do something in the next decade.
Just joined guys! What happened?! Is Tommy ok?!
they purposefully chose an ugly girl too.
Yeah probably, we'll see though. 
It was practically simultaneous so I dont think that's pi I was thinking the same though.
You're in a dome, one of our ends is wide open, and we're likely broader
O bby
I like how the fine print confirms â€œheâ€™s right it is Morse code for clayâ€
Okay 
Neither does Jacksonville 
Low, just how I like it. 
HHHHHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *jumps fence, cracks iPad over knee*
Romo is right though. That crossing route was all placement. 2 feet forward, and itâ€™s probably a first down. 
That didnâ€™t take long
"I agree 

But slow down sir "
Cry some more
we would judge yes
Seriously.  Apple is a computer company.  Everything they make is technically a computer. 
Tommy is 6/6 defense got a stop, pats offense put up 3
I saw this
The unamused thumbs up gets me every time lol
Boo
r/olltide
Boy, I really hope someone got fired for that blunder. 
Our team literally doesnâ€™t tire out. 
Definitely a hufflepuff
That wheel route to Yeldon was the same route Pitt used with Bell vs. NE.  I expect we will see that play a couple of more times.
They had to chop his hand off. BB had the honor. 
"Refund advance!" was amazing Mr. Hamm.
Waaaaaaahhh
Ehhhh
Fans noise level in dB I think
Romo was saying zone was going to be big today. 
Clay Matthews seems like an asshole.
Yes.
And if Brady couldn't read a defense.
Do you know what a commercial is?
They scored on 3 already so how could it be 14?
Naw it's gonna feel pretty fucking good when we win 
"There are people who fly to France, stay in an expensive hotel in Paris, and go to the Louvre just to look at the Mona Lisa on the screen of their iPads.

People are idiots."
He also didn't interfere lol
Are you getting this from somewhere or actually counting? I'm really curious to see the totals.
worthy of r/wheredidthesodago
I thought the Jags were good?
Yeah fuck those guys!
It's a conspiracy!
And that lunge on the blindside block would've been called on a lot of teams too. They're letting them play. 
Gillette Stadium logo - its the bridge and lighthouse.
It's never the wrong thread 
The first part of the season they were struggling but have gotten much better
Cooks eating today
Just slowly chipping away at em 
Well, he went medium anyway
Touchdown Tommy to Danny Dimepiece coming up 
It's good to see Cooks involved this early
Another FG, a TD, and a 2 point conversion eh?
Brady is nearing retirement with every day. Once him and BB leave, we may not win for another 50 years. It may not mean as much, but it still means a lot.
Good to see Cooks getting some catches early on. Time to heat up
"Cooks ate the Jags secondary's lunch during joint practices in preseason. Looking good again so far today.

edit: sure are some sensitive people in here. is what i said offensive, or incorrect?"
Incoming massive cooks game. Brady likey the zone D 
Obviously very early so far, but it seems like a game where afterwards people will say "They had the right gameplan, and if Bortles had made his throws just a little better, they'd have won."
Don't play off of Cooks.
The stats I didn't know I needed. Keep em coming
DOOOOO FALLLLLLLLL
Please don't tell us how much or how little we should enjoy this game. You do you. Thanks.
He is
no one mentions them
Lewis the best running back in the game
Those commercials make him look like a real prick.
Dion always getting  thiose extra yards
didn't you know it was over then brady rushed 1 yard?!?!
Are the Jags really playing nothing but zone so far?
Getting paid
Another field goal and then a TD and we go for 2
It was 1 on 1 and it was at least 6 yards
I'll take you at your word, no hard feelings.
Minnesota has the largest concentration of people of Scandinavian descent in the USA.
And the funny thing is it is mostly jags fans lol. 
Anyone got a count for hand zoom ins? This is a hand models wet dream.
Z o n e c o v e r a g e
Keep grinding 
Was a tackle?
Do you mean total rushing yards? or from just one RB?
COOKIN
Really don't like that Brady has to use his left hand to slide his right hand into his pocket between every play. 
But the jags have only begun to catch those hands
Not where Brady is gonna throw that's where it is. I expect at least one interception against Brady today, and that's still really fucking good considering this Jags D.
Lol that graphic
Honestly, if you hate the Patriots, you hate greatness. You all get the privilege of witnessing the most dominant athlete since Michael Jordan.
"did you see that lady?
she's got a huge ass to look all the way around "
Who hurt you?
Three straight runs.  Hmmmm
execution, good personnel
3 runs?
I'm curious, how do non-Pats fans rank Dion Lewis in terms of the top RBs?
Being too cute for 3rd and short
I wonder if the Pats are trash talking with positive reinforcement today
Tom Brady with 7 times the post season starts as all the other QBs combined... Damn.
A lot of jet action with the receivers... and different receivrs at that. I wonder what they saw on film for that.
Nothing like advocating injuring other people! 
3 run plays. What is Bill thinking?
Go Malcolm butlerrr.. havent seen you showed up in a while pal
Looks like?
Nice one dude.
Not a great punt
:(
If he gets hit or falls? When is he just going to fall over?
Brady's hand is quite obviously an issue. I have no idea what Nantz and Romo are talking about. 
Tony sounded soo disappointed that there would be no replay
Jags are too fast to try this misdirection shit.
Okayish?
Why are we only capable of excellent offensive play calling in the 2nd quarter on? like seriously.
Thank you for this.  
I expected this. I am not even a little bit worried. Definitely.
Fucking Matthew Slater with the rocket boosters.
Well they cut him months ago, so that should tell you everything lol
Run defence is good. Pass defence less good. Bortles is Bortles.
Pretty sure we got rid of him after a couple games. He wasn't very good. 
He was cut about 2 months ago. Think he's on the Seahawks now
He might be, I just think it's a little ignorant to be tapping morse code on Rodgers' walls.
he's been gone for a while now.
He's not with the team anymore lol
wyd with these sweeps lmao 
It's 3:28
He got cut
It looked like the Jet Sweep would have gotten the first down.
He got the recovery.. that looked like the ball was out before he was down tho
He's no longer on the team
Why would there be?
WE SHOULDN"T HAVE TRADED JIMMY!
He's on the 49ers now
Nah he uses his dick. 
He's not on the team anymore, so that probably answers your question.
This Jacksonville defense is very fast. Those two plays would have got the first down against Tennessee.
where is Nic Cage when you need him?
Ugh apple nooooo
I think they are setting up for later
He got cut a while back
He's no longer with us.
While the offense is on the field?  Yeah, I'd hope so
"he's not on the team anymore lol
"
He was complete crap. He could never maintain the edge. We cut him and the Niners picked him up.
Apple with the cringe as always
Released after week 6
That's McDaniels call 
3 straight fucking run plays? Are fucking kidding me? Can we send McDaniels to Indy at halftime?
"We're undefeated with Romo on commentary.

Do you think he's bored with us winning?"
Not good, he's not on the team anymore, released in November.
You need to ask niners fans
fucking iPhone commercials
Not really, just everyone has energy at the moment and adrenaline. Come 3rd quarter it will be fine
Just wondering guys will the eagles vs Vikingâ€™s game have romo on commentary?
I feel bad for Tom Bradyâ€™s other hand.   No one is paying attention to it.
I think it was a stats joke.
It's to keep their edge rush honest as much as anything else. 
Heâ€™s been terrible. Over pursues, misses assignments.
First quarter almost over and no penalties? I can dig it 
He got cut in November.
Didnâ€™t get to cry about Gillette calls 
stay classy
He's so positive that if they lose he'll be sad for like a second, then excited they made it so far
His hair game has been off these past two games, a sign of a declining dynasty :(
Heâ€™s amazing. Weâ€™ve had the fortune to have him a lot this season too. 
What is it with all the handoffs today
Bradyâ€™s hands are so fine heâ€™s forcing the jags to catch them. 
We released him in late-november. He started off well but he was struggling as a rusher, kept over shooting and leaving gaps on the D-line. We cut him and signed Eric Lee i think
Damn, good for you
WHAT'S A COMPUTER?
They will pull a Tomlin eventually and leave Gronk uncovered a couple straight plays. 
He was okay, didnâ€™t play a ton and then got cut a couple months ago. I believe heâ€™s on the niners now
That iphone ad says a lot more about their customers than they think it does
We cut him in November. He's on the 9ers now
Probably keeping the hand underworked 
We cut him in November. We had too many injuries and not enough coverage linebackers unfortunately
just go to /r/nflstreams
I want to kill every single person associated with these commercials. 
Idk if you really dont know or whatever, but he has been cut weeks ago(around week 12-14). Was horrible in setting the edge and not that great as a rusher. He is somewhere else now. I think SF?!
It usually depends if you're closer to Boston or NYC
Every apple commercial is made specifically for hipsters living in Brooklyn.
I've heard Bill Belichick takes away your best weapon. No word if that's true though.
Hope you feel better:)
I really don't like going to side to side with the Jags D. Linebackers are too fast between Jack and Smith. 
I get the Bortles and Foles dumping.. but cmon give Keemun some freaking credit
What do you want the NFL to do about it?
All that talk about Brady's hand only for him to go 7 for 7 in completions lol
He was laying on the ground when the ball came out. 
Well I think we cut him in like so November, so not great
Me, but I wasn't really paying attention to the commercials?
Prolly take an educated guess
Don't want to be too predicable
r/nflstreams
Def looks like NE is trying to spread the field to the sidelines, setting up some stuff over the middle later. 
Probably donâ€™t want Brady throwing too much 
Repeat of Super Bowl, gotta tire them out.
Wow you have missed a lot of Super Bowls. 
Josh*
Why? Theyâ€™ve all been great games 
"Pats 5 total rushes by 5 different players... interesting esp feeding White on 3rd and 3 vs Dion/Burkhead who are clearly better runners
"
These commercials are god awful
Did u just get into football how did you not watch last years
Id probably sell my mut team to get his 99 card
Shhhhhhhh they feel slighted
The Patriots are doing a TON of motion and mis direction in their play calling. I'm excited to see what they're setting up for, I'm worried about a game that needs one play to break it open with the way it's going. That one play could go the Jags way :(
Theres an app for that
Wow you're very cool
It landed 2 years 5 out of bounds.  They judge based on where it went oob
Why?
Dude, not even a whole SorosBuck?
Every single one with maybe the exception of the Eagles has been a thriller , your missing out
He's feeling shit out. Give them time.
"Yea and they are kind of different look ones. I feel like theyâ€™re setting stuff up for later or sticking to a script for now. Theyâ€™re passing fine, unsure why theyâ€™re avoiding it as much as they are.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m on my couch I suppose."
My S8 takes pretty damn good pics for a phone. 
My guess is theyâ€™re trying to tire out the D early.
Itâ€™s true. We donâ€™t play particularly well until the second quarter. 
"/r/nfl complaining about ""what's a computer"" is at least twice as annoying as the commercial itself.

There, I said it."
"One man's terrorists are another man's freedom fighters. 

AKA, Patriots. "
Honestly fuck the playcalling today. One drive stalled by consecutive fucking screen passes and the next drive stalled by three straight runs. What the fuck are we doing?
TRUE
Rocky and Superman scores always gets me right in the heart.
"Right elbow touched before the ball was knocked. 

Granted, it takes the slomo, individual frame, bullshit to really see that (which I hate more than I like). But youâ€™re right, White recovered it anyway. "
Apple commercials
What's a computer?
Donâ€™t wanna overreact, but the dynasty is over and we should resign Bledsoe
Lol oh please
You had me at Brady
part of the agreement probably
He literally doesn't have a right hand anymore. rip :(
Superior Donuts? Is that a real show or is CBS running parody commercials of themselves? 
WhAtS a CoMpUtEr?
He really doesn't
I've seen this shitty trophy commercial so many times and I don't think I've remembered what it's advertising a single time
tom brady is going luke skywalker on the jags 
That's not a gift.
Nice.
"Bortles is such a weird surname

Nobody talks about this"
If the Pats get up by 2 scores it is over.
Follow your Mormon heart and continue rooting for him
wtf 53
"RPO"
what's a computer?
Far too early to say that lol, they donâ€™t pick random plays. Theyâ€™re showing them looks now so they can exploit shit later 
RPO
RPO! Drink!
Don't put our white LB on him
Roethlisbergerâ€™s anus must be numb by TB12 annually raping him. My, how the tables have turned.
"Real football" 
Keep pounding it on the ground. Brady already looks pretty comfortable throwing, a few decent runs will open it up even more. 
Usually after the half when Bill threatens their families. 
I mean at least give Tom Fucking Brady a chance
Just wanna let everyone know that if you find a heavily censored reddit thread (like that 'military gets to watch nfl now' thread) just change reddit.com to removeddit.com and it'll show what was removed. It's always interesting to see what was censored.
I can't imagine hating a player so much that I refuse to watch the championship game of they're involved.  
Jacksonville getting away with so much offensive holding
How else will people know I have opinions?
If thereâ€™s one thing I come to these game threads for, itâ€™s people complaining about specific commercials.
Blake â€œNick â€œRun Pass Optionâ€ Folesâ€ Bortles
apple commercials.
"If you're bored of it you probably shouldn't let them come back from a 28-3 deficit.

Just saying."
Nice to see Head Coach Coughlin
Lee on Lee crime
Gotta play the stereotype. Hilarious reactions as expected.
Scorpion is still a show? 
No. It has actual in-episode plot that is at least an attempt at being interesting. Itâ€™s not *good,* but the genre difference helps it a lot. 
Rushing 3, we definitely going to try and make Bortles beat us today
Yes.  It's is more probable than not, Brady has a hand.
Jags o line feels like a brick wall
no, no and maybe if you're allergic
tbh i want that phone for selfies
Oof ouch owie their quarterback
If Minnesota makes it, prices will be really high since MIN fans don't have to spend on flights and hotels and can put all their budgets into ticket prices. 
Thatâ€™s the pats d I know!
Coughlin being in the building scares me 
Even though I grew up with refrigerators, I knew what an ice box was.
Lull them to sleep and then jump all over them. Honestly looked kinda bad first quarter last week too and then just flipped the switch
"Yes

Did surname give it away?"
Scorpion looks like they took the worst parts of the technology nonsense from NCIS and made a show about it.
#you dont own me
Pats are winning
I think it is already over that. 
Wow. The first quarter flew by.
Yes. Its exactly how it sounds
Under
Jesus, that' a quick 1Q
Because it sounds funny
He sets the standards and culture? And they are winning now? 
HE AIN'T GONNA DIE!!!
My rogue on Rift was named Bortles.  Before i quit I used to go to the earlist PVP area, stun the enemy and recite the Boondock Saints prayer and then 1 shot them.
Yo, D, get a stop. Thanks.
Meh, I just think about those 5 trophies
Shitposts in the game threads I bet 
"And there are more Icelandic people than actual Vikings in Iceland. My point is that it doesn't matter.

In fact, with only 300k people in Iceland, there are probably more Viking descendants in the great lakes region.."
Very quick first quarter
Looking for a tuuuuuurrrrnnnn oooooooooover. 
idk but arians always stood out to me. dude looked like he would explode
:(
I think it was a crappy eay of saying bend but dont break
That was quick
No heâ€™s good
The fuck. That quarter went fast as hell.
Second quarter already?
He has been great.
That was a quick quarter 
How ate you guys still so fucking salty. Let it go.
Lol, whiffed about three times there on that one.
You can freely listen to good rock music whenever you want.
I like to think he's been very good with us
RemindMe! 2 weeks
I don't know if I agree. on the one hand you have, "what's a computer". on the other hand you have coopting Mohammed Ali and one of his powerful quotes. I think they are equally bad in different ways.
No, the commercial is worse. 
that's pretty much every team ever.
Yea......
Smooth as room temperature butter. 
"He missed that high five
"
Good job CBS dont show the replay.
It is, but aren't all hypotheticals in this game?
Bortles has more pass attempts than Brady. Fuck everything
"Bortles the QB" is what a Chinese knockoff of a Brady QB toy would be called.
You will support us forever now that we gave you the most handsome QB in the league. 
Lol which one?
I wish people would stop giving Clint Eastwood money to make propaganda films. 
no one wants to watch the pro bowl
Bortles looking good. Jags can definitely move the ball on this D. Need turnovers 
It was, hasn't even been a half hour
Who is the "Totally Verizon" girl?
Lightning.  not a lot of clock stoppages.
who the hell *wants* to go to war?
It's a sex move
Thatâ€™s the first catch Gilmore has allowed in the playoffs
No longer gate bros
You've never been directly affected by our success other than getting a franchise QB.  This relatively common feeling from Niners fans always confuses me.
I hate the sprint guy even more 
That is not what he said at all.
GUCCI GANG GUCCI GANG  GUCCI GANG GUCCI GANG GUCCI GANG GUCCI GANG GUCCI GANG GUCCI GANG GUCCI GANG GUCCI GANG
So?
Pick pick pick pick
The skills competition game stuff is fun. But Iâ€™m a sucker for shitty reality competitions like that. 
Then find a new one
It's on Fox.  It's possible ps vue doesn't carry the local affiliate in your area.
nah.... seahawks color rush is awful
I highly doubt it. Also, I don't think first round steals are a thing.
Anyone else feel kinda off about the guys who saved people on the train now acting in a movie about it? 
Can we start a separate thread for commentary on commercials?
Lol well put
Sounds like something an actual football analyst would say lmao
Lack of penalties, 3 and outs, and no huddle offense at times.
The cover of Daft Punk the world did not need 
He's playing ok but both drops were from off throws behind receiver.
Lots of runs
This is what worried me the entire week going into this game. Long, hard hitting sustained drives are hard on a defense. Need someone to make a play.
wHaT's A hOrSe-AnD-bUgGy?
Except passing the ball has already been working. We just stopped attempting passes for some reason.
We ran it three times and then kicked a shitty punt
Because nobody died
Thatâ€™s not nice, just because they made you team look like a bad peewee team does not mean you should wish harm to them. 
Because RKO?
CBS did NOT just tease me with the Masters in mid January 
I was wondering if it was just me, too. But others have confirmed as well. Like wtf apple the computer girl is so annoying.
Man, Marrone really seems to get the short-end of the stick; anytime something good happens on field for the Jags, I always hear it attributed to the influence of Coughlin.
Daft Punk
So we've failed on two drives now solely because playcalling has taken the ball out of Brady's hands. It's pathetic that Jax trusts Bortles more than we evidently trust Brady.
I wonder how much hate we'll get in the game thread this week. 
Cover a man guys!!! Geez
Damn :(
What is this shitty version of Stronger
Ever hear the phrase "don't look into the backfield"
Patriots D really needs to put their heads down and do their fucking jobs. Too many chunk plays.
This feels like the bowls against the giants. Very conservative game plan. Long sustained drives. Bottle up the pats in the red zone.  FUCK COUGHLIN
Guys what the fuck 
Fucking CTV in Canada is taking way too long commercial breaks. Missing some of the game
did u check out r/nflstreams
Grant tearing us up. Fuck. 
I was mostly disturbed by how he couldn't hit easy notes. 
Nothing happened! Football was cancelled! 
This defense has a lead. Nooooo!
No pressure on Bortles at all
Why cover RBs?
Fuuuuuuu
Good old early game defense....
That's not a Patriots fan. Fan = fanatic. That's like... someone who happens to side for one team.
Tom Coughlin back from the dead to ruin my life
Didnâ€™t even cover him
Bortles out here rippin' cigs.
Terrible coverage dude was wide open.
JAX making it look easy. 
Our defense fucking sucks..
Secondary communication problems are back. Yikes. 
That may have been the worst trailer I've seen in the past 10 years in terms of effort
This is fine
great. Now we get to play catch up.
Good job refs!
wtf even defense 
#32 defense vs Jags
Well that's cause for some concern
Patriots are so scared of the run it's ridiculous. 
They made those last few plays look easy.
They are *killing* us in the flats holy shit
Pats D has fell for every play fake. 
wait is his name mercedes?
FUCK
Terrible defense
"Everything has a perspective and story to tell. Everything is not propaganda. Clintâ€™s military films ere much more on the side of propaganda than they tell a story. Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers arenâ€™t propaganda. 

And Iâ€™m not. Doesnâ€™t mean I canâ€™t voice an opinion that Iâ€™m tired of them. "
Bortles tricked the fuck out of me there jeez
Lol Chung just got destroyed
Fuck our defense and fuck our playcalling. 
Bruh come on chung 
Well. Crap.
So I guess we're not covering the flats today. That's all they did the whole drive
Stop biting on the fakes.
We are getting killed on that pass to the flat.  Come on boys, cover it better
Gonna be a tight game
Possibly
Shit... the cats made that drive look easy.  
Oh boy Jim
Calm down Romo Jesus lmao 
Jesus Christ, I could've thrown those last two passes. Making it so fucking easy for them. 
It's almost like vastly underestimating a team is a bad idea
Chung bit hard on the play-action
I wish Blake Bortles was my dad
Iâ€™ll get my hand involved with her cam
Thats a huge as long as 
Time to respond! lets dance!
If Jacksonville wins this game, they better win the whole fucking thing
"Easily" might be a stretch. They certainly can win this game, though
"LETS GO DEFENCE
"
Calm down Romo, you were this excited when the Titans had a 7 point lead
give the ball to fournette excessively the first quarter so that the pats arent looking for anything else
"OR NOT
"
They were losing last week for a bit too. I am not worried. 
Grant and Lewis gonna fuck us up c'mon linebackers and Chung get it together
I ain't skeetered
"Forgot about Lewis as a weapon. He was great in the London game.
"
Probably in the first second quarter of a four quarter game 
Lil early there huh?
Fuck man I knew this game scared me as soon as we beat the titans fuck fucj fuck 
"Simms told me Bortles was the #70 rated QB and that I shouldn't be worried. 

I am worried."
Looks JAX found the rl equivalent to that bitch play in early Madden games that worked every time no matter the D.
Have mercy Blake
Titans scored first. Look how that turned out.
Fair play to the Jags. We're making them use Bortles to heat us and he's been up to the task so far.
Ok this drive let's not just run it 3 plays in a row
Weâ€™ve got ourselves a game boys 
It's 1 qtr in.. I think we'll be ok
I don't think there were many.  Like 7 maybe, lol
what about 50% completion Blake?
Chung keeps looking lost out there.
Good theyre ahead, now stop playing this bullshit conservative offense
That was an atrocious series by the D. At least 3 blown assignments.
Weak linebackers getting exposed there.
Aw damn, guess the pats are done, we've never come back from a deficit
Fantastic play action play there.
IS THIS WHAT A GAME BEING OVER LOOKS LIKE
r/iamverysmart
Pats D getting fooled quite a bit rn
No. 
"Is that really how you spell his first name? 
"
The Jags are just way faster. Not gonna be too worried yet, since the Titans scored first too, but then again the Titans weren't even comparable to these guys.
OH BOY JIM!!! OH BOY!!!
Thereâ€™s 45 mins left, can we chill. 
I mean I've been predicting them winning from before this game started fuck the defense is just too good.
Fat Pat Chung strikes again
It's 7-3 in the second quarter and you guys are proclaiming that the game is over and the Pats have lost and that "it's happening". Really guys? I get you guys hate us, but jeez.
Oh shit. Bortles doing Bortle thingsðŸ˜©
Coughlin sending chills up my spine in that box
Didnâ€™t the Titans score a TD before New England in that game? Nah man this game is over after that...
Raise him. Raise your son!
Except heâ€™s a safety
We're pure evil :)
That was a great drive by the Jags. Lots of wrinkles. Pats need an answer and need to keep the defense off the field for a second.
Aw alright
"Two chunk plays to RBs behind the LOS lead directly to a score. 

They like to pick and block down field. Zone stops that."
I want to see him be a Borthole. 
#IT AIN'T OVER YET, HANG ON TO YOUR BUTT CHEEKS. 
You of all fans should know that underdog team getting the ball down less than a score at the end of the game is our kryptonite.
C'mon defense.
Interesting uh, arm extension there.
Come on D
WHAT ARE YOU DOING GILMORE!?
Cmon now. Harmon INT to finish it off. As is tradition
"They hate us cause they ain't us!




(Downvotes away!)"
If we get fucking MEMED I swear to GOD
My heart rate
Flowers just saved the season.
Come on D, don't let us down.
people acting like pats just won this lol
oh man this is so nervewracking. bortles had fournette on that play
WTF team
Not calling holding on the Jaguars line either.
subscribe
Time for the infamous Duron Harmon game ending interception?
Seems pretty good to me so far
This paper D better not fuck it up
Thanks for letting us know.
ooh, if Bortles had thrown that better, he might have scored a TD
Come on defense. Donâ€™t let us down.
I'm terrified of derp qbs in the playoffs. Someone hold me
Lol
Perfect time for a patriots defensive collapse
GILETTE IS PLAYING CRANBERRIES
Now you know how Pats fans feel with every rodiculous accusation
This isn't over yet. Pats better not go to sleep.
Every time I see an LB in coverage on an RB wheel route my butt hole clenches
COME ON D
DEBO
TONY ROMO SHUT THE FUCK UP
We're screwed.
Dude, do you expect people to like the Pats? Who gives a shit if they're biased?

Patriots legend James Harrison
Yes!~
James 'this is for Pittsburgh' Harrison
Dilly dilly continues to evolve
DILLY DILLY. 
I'm not going to believe we've won this until we have the lead with the clock on triple 0s
Harrison has been making plays! So glad the team signed him. He's bringing the pass rush (by someone not named flowers) we've needed all season
I'll give these bud light commercials some credit. They aren't all the same thing over and over.
He knows..it's not over until the clock strikes 0.
THEY HAVE THE BUD LIGHT 
Lol
!redditsilver
That poor RB had to block a DT while two O-Liners blocked no one...
Harrison lol. Steelers could have used him.
Fuck. So close.
Please No...
Budweiser gonna ride that Dilly Dilly train as long as they can 
Whoever is in charge of Bud Lights ad campaign needs a significant raise. Dilly dilly!
Opinion: Dilly Dilly isnâ€™t and never was funny
James Motherfucking Harrison 
Ok bud light you win 
I'm sure there's a fanfic somewhere 
YES SACK!!! HARRISON!
The refs made Bortles fumble 
Shoutout to Anheuser-Busch for only taking seven years to find out about Game of Thrones
PATRIOTS LEGEND JAMES HARRISON
Yeah Acadia is amazing, I love it there! 
Oh is it only 7 refs? Accounts have differed, Iâ€™ve heard as high as 17. 
Dude got ragged on for being overpaid for a bit here but he is clutch af. I love Dola.
'James Harrison won't do anything for the Pats'.
DEEBO
I keep shitting my pants but I NEVER SEEM TO RUN OUT OF SHIT WTF IS THIS GAME DOING TO ME
Lol the Seahawks lost to the jags this year
"You go to hell 

You go to hell and you die"
Brady's dick is omnipresent. It's in all of our mouths.
This is the most stressed Iâ€™ve been in a while 
Iâ€™m actually going to throw up because of this game. Iâ€™m so nervous.
Sadly, we may still lose 
â€œIn your heaaaaad....â€
K
thank god for james harrison
I need stronger alcohol.
Up until 15 secs on the play clock I believe
Bortles has never lost a playoff game. You can't count him out of this.
Fighting for beer? Now that's a war I'd gladly fight 
Thats the OG Bruins goal song
"3rd and a mile when the opponent is already in must-go-for-it mode. 

Do not play soft here!!! Bury them!"
James 'Patriot Legend' Harrison.
Nah I wouldn't count the Jags out yet
I'm not surprised lmaoa
Is there a hockey equivalent here?
Not even every year. *shudders thinking of 07 and 11*
Can this dilly dilly crap already stop with this fake ass murican beer.
"JAMES HARRISON!!!! 

THE SALT!!!!!!!
"
One more stop let's go
The five rings before didn't already convince you lol
In a sports movie Tom Brady would be torn to shreds as the most outrageous Gary Stu ever so yeah
"Dilly Dilly!

official rallying cry of beer league softball teams nationwide "
The same could be said, the first two drives the Pats were conservative I feel as if they were trying to get a feel of what the jags were trying to do when they came back out 
"well hes the goat

"
He might be a robot. He might be satan. We're not sure, but he rarely expresses emotions.
#DILLY DILLY
Thatâ€™s not how this works 
">cheer on those lovable plucky underdog Yankees

I think I'm gonna throw up"
So many babies ITT.
Fuck, that ad got me hyped! Dilly Dilly!
It never changes man. My heart is beating like crazy and my dad is screaming 
"Too bad that story about TMFB getting a sixth finger surgically added to his hand is fake. It's pretty clear he's gonna need it!

SIX RINGS!"
Bortles is leagues above keenum.
Alright I understand that people feel the game isnâ€™t being called fairly. Itâ€™s the nature of these game threads, but wanting the game called â€œfairlyâ€ after the refs make a mistake is unrealistic. Just because they missed a call earlier does not mean the refs should ignore a a clear pass interference (especially since they had more time to get in position and observe the interaction between wide receiver and defensive back, referees are only human and make mistakes and sometimes things happen quickly in football). Its unfortunate for the Jaguars that things like that happen, but things like this happen to every team. The game isnâ€™t â€œfixedâ€, referees also make mistakes just like the players often do.
Look at the NBA with the Warriors, same problem 
nephew
TO THE PIT OF MISERY, JAGS
Nope
"Why? Its not like your team blew a huge lead recently....

Ohh... Yea, sorry"
It's his first time to a championship game, poor guy.
He's restructured his deal and taken less to stay with the Pats a few times hasn't he?
He pinned the ball to his thigh. That counts as control; relevant for going out of bounds or catching the ball before it hits the ground.
So did Bud Light think at the beginning of the season that "Dilly Dilly" would be a successful meme and make all these commercials, or see how big it got and quickly make all these new ones?
James Harrison jesus
This sucks guys, pats always have the most boring Super Bowls, shit man Iâ€™m sorry
I feel like all of these Bud Light commercials are just people making terrible decisions while drinking  Bud Light... Dily dilly on over to /r/holdmybeer
I age about 5 years. 
Remember when he was a roster bubble player with the cowboys on hard knocks?
3rd and long against a Coughlin team? We are so fucked 
WE NEED A DURON HARMON INT RIGHT NOW
What? Romo's been pouring the love on to Jacksonville this game(not undeserved either)
Lol Jesus Christ
Cmon now. You can do better than that. I'm from Lynn, MA, btw.
Don't FUCKING BLINK
Yes, these jags are pushovers
That's what I told my friend too when he joked Bortles GOAT. I said sure he might score here, but might leave enough time for Brady to be Brady! The All time GOAT
Is bortles ready for this moment? I wouldn't think so but Here. We. Go.
Amen
Blake "Joe Flacco" Bortles
????
People say they hate the Patriots but they make the most entertaining playoff games and especially Super Bowls
Pats playing more contain than pressure.
just so uncalled for lmao 
JS. You conveniently left out the part where the guy you love has been agreeing with the refs all game.
Dola is an obvious weapon. Harrison is the secret weapon
You can almost be assured that they will
Subtle. I like it.
LOOKIN LIKE A KING AND SHIT! 
Your book sucks and so do you
Should have won MVP this season
One Harmon Specialâ„¢, please!
A few months ago I heard more linkin park than I ever had before.
Lead singer passed this week. Maybe a tribute? Odd timing.
this aint over by a long shot 
Hey this isnt a Lions parking lot, we have some class.
We've given Gilmore a lot of shit this year, but WHAT A PLAY! And WHAT A TIME TO MAKE IT!
65 mil$ play right there
"GILLY GILLY
"
"game of inches, a few inches another way and that's a TD.

Damn, good throw Bortles, just better play Gilmore."
what a fucking play
Phenomenal play by Gilmore
Stephon "Cut this loser at week 4" Gilmore baby
WOW GILMORE WHAT A PLAY OMG
STEPHON I HATED YOUR CONTRACT BUT NOW I LOVE IT. 
Do. Not. Give. The. Ball. Back.
What a ducking play, holy shit
You. I like you.
"WHAT
A PLAY"
What a play by Gilmore.
GILMOREEEEE
Is that why we signed Gilmore?
That's why he got $60m
Let's Go GOAT!
thereâ€™s still a minute and a half left bro. Chill.
In the last pats drive they said 98 to Jags
I have never had a love hate relationship with a player more than I do with Stephon Gilmore 
DAAAAMNNN
In all seriousness, props to Jacksonville. They played really well. until it mattered. 
Through this live sorting on the Reddit mobile app Iâ€™m loving it seeing this thread blowing up even though it crashes my app every time. 
"bullshit there way"
Oh god.
300 to 5
CAN WE FUCKING PAY OUT ALL OF GILMORE'S CONTRACT RIGHT NOW HOLY FUCK
I came
Play of our season for Gilmore. Unbelievable.
Ya watching greatness is so boring. 
GILMOREEEE!
You're a Jags fan? haha
GILMORE TAKE ALL OF MY MONEY PLEASE
STEPHON GILMORE IS A SHUTDOWN CORNER DONT @ ME
That was dirty what Gilmore did to that little girl
GILMORE!
Gilmore's best play all year!!
Biggest play of Gilmore's career right there
"HELLL YEAAAA GILMOREE!!!!

And that's why you pay Gilmore 65 million
They could still lose in the SB.
Unfucking real. Badass stop.
What's your favorite of the chains? 
Gilmo-my-god!!! 
Alright, just a couple of first downs to end the game
Bless you Gilmore 
I WANT IT ALLLLL
That's game ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for trying Jags
Right about half I think, and it's been picking up slightly. Not sure about this game.
The game isn't over. Keep pushing
whats up stephon gilmore!!!
Not in my house!
Need to bounce it off both uprights and still have it go through for that.
Alright, just a couple of first downs to end the game
GILMORE IS MY FATHER
i complemented the patriots while the jags still had 3 TOs.  sorry guys
It still isnt over.
You should know that they don't listen
That's gonna be Super Bowl commercial guaranteed
lol for what?
"Good game guys! What a fun game to watch!

"
Hooooly shit, LFG
Don't worry my ego is still very small, Texas A&M keeps it in check
Open or eat it.
First down is the game here
**HAPPY GILMORE**
Bastard ran out of his shoes. Dude is amped up
Come on Lewis, redeem yourself. 
"It's funny how the ref don't flag Gilmore for jumping.

- everyone in this thread"
I felt that way in the first half
"that is the sickest looking pass defensed ive ever seen
"
Confidence level at 40%

#LIL DIRTY!
Game over.. That was brilliant from Dion
LIL DIRTY
HAHAHAHAHAHAH LEWIS 
lil dirty!!!
"Jags are probably getting the ball back.

Edit: Jinx successful."
I almost want to remove my flair, I got 22 downvotes for saying that Ramseyâ€™s DPI was, by the book, DPI. No Iâ€™m not suggesting the game is being called fairly, Iâ€™m saying that play was defensive pass interference...
Happy Belichick!
Nice Jags D there.
DION SAVED IT FOR THE END
Wow, Lewis clutched it in for the win.
#GAME BLOUSES!!!
Bills got a chub
even belichick was excited 
"Look at me, I'd edgy"

Stephon Gilmore. Bills CB we gave a giant contract to.
Hey. Fuck all of you 
God Dam we're so fucking good. Greatest team over the last 18 years
LEWISSSSSSSSS
Forreal GG jag fans. Most of you were class and all the hate was coming from other teams. 
He has been our best corner since Week 4 
Belichick smiling 
#THEY *CAN* KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT!
Game
Tom Brady is going back to the Tom Brady invitational
So?
I have a lot more respect for Blake Bortles after this game
And then somehow lose in overtime without touching the ball again
Damn Jacksonville came to play. Holy shit that was a game! 
RUMORS OF THE PATRIOTS' DEMISE WERE GREATLY EXAGERRATED!
YEEEEEEESSSSSS!
WHAT A FUCKING GAME
yup
THAT'S GAME. BRADY IS GOD.
Going to the fucking Super Bowl BB showed emotion this is so fucking awesome
Dion!!!!!
Never in doubt
Fuck all you losers. Go Pata

Yes. Portals cries.
JAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Jalen Ramsey you going to the Super Bowl?

Gilmore was worth every dollar just for that play!
Bortles is a legit QB. No one should ever question him again.
The tear running down Bortlesâ€™ face... ugh poor dude
Awwww poor baby
wow Bortles crying, guy did great
Stop watching then
Super Bowl bound. Eat it. 
LOWER THE BORTLES
Gilmore with his best defensive game of all time

DILLY DILLY
Yeah, start a fight jags, thatâ€™ll get you the win!
Lower your bortles.
"Super bowl :) 

Spez: downvote for facts eh? "
LEWIS REDEMPTION BABY
that's a well fucking played game for the Jags, the should be able to build on this and most likely make a serious run for the Superbowl next year 
Let's go!!!!!!
The happiest I've seen Belichick since the blocked field goal against Atlanta week 7.
We're on to the Superbowl!
He was down by contact.
Good game Jags fans.  Your team played a kickass game, and proved the nauseatingly overconfident folks around here wrong.  Hard-fought game that someone had to lose.
You're a donkey. 
Will we see HOYER THE DESTROYER or not? This was the true purpose of the game, after all.
Still watching?
BB loves it
I canâ€™t believe we came back 
Lol there was holding there... but gg.
~~SUPERBOWL LEGEND~~ BLAKE BORTLES
GODDAMN I LOVE R/NFL SALT
Goats going back to the bowl 
the most amount of BB has ever shown
YESSSSSS
They'll probably play it anyway. 
I don't want to meet them in the postseason.
"> kneel at the end of the half with 55 seconds and 2 timeouts

> lose by one score

Congratulations, You played yourself "
Dion running out all that fumble frustration. 
Aw man, bortles played his heart out. You will be back next year jaguars. Keep your head up!
Lol
WOOOOOOOOOO
Classless Jags 
Jags pulling a Seattle 
LEWIS COMING IN HUUUUUGE
#super bowl 
">people will see your flair and think less of Pats fans

LOLOL as if that were possible."
Sorry for being happy about something we like do good, I guess
Lol
Yeah, it was like 3 in a row. I definitely loved that they ran on first down every time deep in their territory
This was for Gronk
No, it's not Josh's last game with the Pats
Why don't other teams get better? Lol
Ballgame, Lewis

Cry a fucking river."
i was saying, â€œLETS FUCKING GO!â€
Amendola MVP of the game
"these jags needed a humbling

so chippy"
I'm buying a Gilmore jersey right fucking now
I am sorry to Jags fans, your team is great
Getting classy 'ville.
Told ya
Get better then.
I'd like to personally thank Jalen Ramsey for making this victory taste so much sweeter!
JACKSONVILLE DIRTY ASS. GET THE FUCK BACK TO FL. BYE BYE
Don't look past your game tonight. Ask the Steelers.... 
Is Blake Bortles elite?
You should worry about tonight first. 
I never talk shit on here but fuck all the people saying thus game was over, pats fans in particular.
"â€œWe going to the super bowl! And we gon win dat bitch!â€ 

- Jalen Ramsey"
Jags fans, you guys have a great team and I'm sorry for the refs fucking y'all like that. You should've had the W and the super bowl appearance instead of us. GG 
Oh man, I've always liked Bortles, sucks to see him sad
"You know you've won the game when **Belichick** is celebrating.

GG Jags, seriously. See you next year!"
Can we get a camera on Ramseyâ€™s bitch ass
Evil wins again!
SUCK MY DICK /R/NFL
YOU COME FOR THE KING, YOU BEST NOT MISS.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
">Enjoy the loss today

heh"
So stop us
I'm a bandwagoner? lol, hell of an insult, so weak. Funny thing is you're ravens get more PIs than the pats. 
The empire did nothing wrong...
Whose team is falling apart now bub?
Jags going full Seahawks, salty fucking losers
PEACE JAGS!!!!
Hey man, want to share any more of your brilliance? Why are you even posting in this sub...
Is that pile of salt blinding you or something?
Salty Jags on the field
Gilmore is the story. 
"Good game Jaguars 

Suck it haters "
Hey Jag bros, good game. You guys definitely have a bright future. 
Respect Bortles. Good ass game. 
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE PATRIOTS WENT TO THE SUPERBOWL
Gotta believe, my dude. Cheers.

"Jags D are dirty and cocky. 

Yet we are hated?"
Never any doubt....umm....right?

We really can't keep getting away with it guys.
I do.
lmao these conspiracies. 
ANOTHA ONE BABY
N E A T
Damn. I actually kinda feel bad for bortles. Hell of a game Jags fans. Hell of a game. Fuck all the other teams but jags bros that was good shit. 
Nothing but respect for Bortles.  Next year maybe people will put some respect on his name 
Lewis Redeemed!!!! 
Love you brother
Show some class Jags
"Anyone that thought Jax had a chance in this game, hasn't been paying attention.

Hahahahhahahahahaha haters"
& then Jacksonville wants to fight. GG Jags, you guys have a great young team.
Calm down there
HOLY FUCK!!!!!!
Yahoo!
Assuming you know, the Vikes don't get there first. Either way, looking forward to it!
Awwww cry bortles cry
What a fucking game
Never count out the PATS!!
G fucking g
Oh boy
Fuck all yâ€™all 
PATRIOTS!!!! 
Who's getting clowned now?
Something was lacking. Let's call it... heart.
Where Ramsey at thooooooo
See ya
Nice fuckin try Ba-la-kay
Oh he's actually crying :(
Lol sorry r/nfl your hopes have been dashed again 
What a game
fuck yeah. i DVRâ€™d this game too
BELICHICK WITH THE EMOTION
Oh man the Jags salt on these kneel down is so tasty
"I was cheering so hard for the Jags last week and I was so against them this game...and I feel....empty
"
I like Bortles, but dammit man wipe your face
FUCK YOU /R/NFL!! FUCK YOU!
Take the L Jags!
:3
Jagsbros:  You guys are a scary mother fucking team.  See you next year and I think you have a chance to do this again next season.  Your defense is the fucking real deal!
Gg jags
What a ball game. 
FUCK YEAH
Suck is NFL
The biggest play of the year for this team. Worth every guaranteed dollar on that play. 
"G f'ing G, Jags. 

That took years off my life."
Sad Bortles new meme
FUCK YOU JALEN RAMSEY
Finally this fucking bortles meme can die now
WHOOOO! Never thought they could get it running on 3rd! Fuck YA!
Well to be honest u can't even write this shit
Why this team continues to take years off my life is beyond me... 
No Gronk, No Edelman, vs #1 pass defense. The fucking GOAT.
Jax, that's when you kneel with 55 seconds left. Not in the first half
Sorry r/NFL. 
8th SB.
Jacksonville showing 0 class right now
Try getting good and not count out teams 
i don't like seeing sad bortles.  
Haha, fuck you all. 
HUG ME BROTHA
I thought you guys were going to the Super Bowl and winning that shit? What happened? 
Boo hoo
Dion fucking lewis
Fuck you all.
Yeah, Mohammed Ali was soooo bad for Boxing, MJ horrible for the NBA, etc.
Get good theb
No no no no paid off the refs. Shits rigged.
He was down by contact anyways
He had communications issues the first four weeks, he's been lights out ever since
Keep it coming guys. I love the salt.
I think its Florida actually
WHAT A COME BACK!
GG by the jags. You're contenders for sure
Praise be his name
Hahaha loser.
ALMOST GOT US, r/nfl!! ALMOST GOT US.   More jerking off with your tears tonight
HOW'S THE SALT HERE!!!!!!!??????????
And yet we have it. 
Bortles is a a good QB,and I have nothing against JAX. That was a fun game to watch.
GG Jaguars, you guys are gonna be a force to reckon with for the next few seasons. Gotta get a new QB though 
He was down by contact...
Facts. Everyone needs to lay off the salt 
What play calls particularly upset you?
My mouth is ready
Thanks refs!! See you in two weeks!
Good game by Bortles. Much respect! 
C u there bby
Hey r/nfl, how are you
Gotta give it to Bortles though what a game for him
And this without Gronk!
Tony is a great announcer
Who's melting down? Lol
HAT AND T SHIRT GAME, BUT I WANT THE NEXT HAT AND T SHIRT IN 2 WEEKS
Bellichick was happier about that first down than he's been about some Super Bowls
"FUCK YOU HATERS

YOU AND YOUR TEAMS AINT SHIT"
Danny"Playoff" Amendola!
( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
He's been great since he was sat for 3 weeks. Easily our best back the second half, and nobody has said anything other than that.  He was terrible first 5 or so games
Never count out the New England Reftriots
I'm soooo salty ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Thank you for playing in the Patriots invitational game.  See you next year.
Lol okay bub
This is gonna be a fun 2 week here on r/nfl
yessss!!!!!
Miami?
Thanks
THE PATRIOTS ARE GOING  TO SUPER BOWL 52.  FUCK ALL YOU MOTHER FUCKERS
"dude how can you watch that game and say that's not great fb

was LI a snoozefest? XLIX? the game is *fine* you just don't like the laundry."
Rest up Gronk
And to everyone except for jags fans, suck my diiiiiick
Meant the Jaguars D. Punt it, use 3 timeouts. But I guess there was enough time for both. 
Injured hand, Gronk knocked out by dirty play, NP, off to the SUPERBOWL AGAIN!!
What's up, haters.
Iâ€™M HERE FOR THE SALT MOTHERFUCKERS
THE GREATNESS
LET'S FUCKING GO!!!!
http://yourteamcheats.com
Fuck yeah! I can't believe this! 
Good fucking game jags 
Great fucking season Jaguars, you killed it in spite of everybody always giving you shit. I hope we can meet you guys here again next year.
GG Jags. 
IM FULLY NUDE
G.O.A.T. 
Dude earned his entire contract on that one play.
GOOOOAAAAATTTTTTT
Everybody got paid off, totally not just a good game and a great win!
so the refs, right?
"We know. 

Sincerely, 

NE"
Hell yes
FUCK YOU GUYS
Your delusional
Bortles played so good today, almost makes me sad.
"We!

We believe!! 

We believe in victory!!

We believe in victory!!!
"
Oh man, that tear running down Bortles' cheek was such a sad shot.
DILLY DILLY ANOTHER W FOR BILLY
Yes you are, don't be silly.
Pats still lost with the spread, what benefit did Vegas have?
"Man every single game, holy shit.

Go suck a field of dicks"
I tried
Flair up or don't talk crap
DILLY FUCKING DILLY!!!!
Jags are young, they got a good future. Hopefully they learned not to shit talk the GOAT. 
Bortles busted
Jags you had the better team. But not the W.
No gronk, no thumb, no problem.
GG Jax. Hope this isn't a one time thing, your teams potential is scary.
#BLITZFORSIX
Bortles DID AMAZING, sry the Jags D were too cocky
Jags trying to start a fight with the game over. Stay classy Jacksonville. 
Naw.
Fuck all yâ€™all bitches 
REwrite history?! Just writing the first drafts each week/year.
https://imgur.com/73lHSwz
He's been making plays all season. He's played great 90% of the time.
HAHAHA FUCK YOU /R/NFL
That was a damn good game and Bortles played a lot better than I thought. If we lost this game I was 100% rooting for the Jags in the SB. We definitely got away with one
It was fucking amazing. Contrast it to butler who got abused.
FUCK ALL YOU HATERS HAHAHABAHABAHAHHA
"# @ /u/Peeved_Pundit

# @ /u/Peeved_Pundit

you ain't winning shit "
Good game Jacksonville.  It was cute how you almost won.  Jaylen Ramsey is a hell of a player.   Guarantees are also very fucking cute.  
So many people mad.. hahahah.
what a game
Dilly dilly!
Being totally honest I'm way less interested these days. I was talking about this with my Jets fan friend it's just absurd at this point.
NE automatically makes it boring?
G O F O R S I X
No. 
That much salt cannot be good for your health.
Hahaha what?  Fucking pathetic. They're playing best football you can ever watch. But you want a less skilled Superbowl because of a logo?  Lol
Get on your knees and pray for forgiveness and bill might not smite you
EZ clap
Ratings disagree with you, but whatever.
WE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
Gilmore straight up fucking defied Gravity. 
Death and taxes... 
hahaha
Impossible the pats are just way more disciplined right? That should be evident enough in their demeanors off the field. 
I don't think anybody would've watched if Jacksonville went to the superbowl lmao
Bortles woke up...thank God.  You guys took us to the edge.
GOTTA BELIEVE! GOTTA BELIEVEGOTTA BELIEVEGOTTA BELIEVEGOTTA BELIEVEGOTTA BELIEVE
r/nfl on suicide watch
Nothing like a good Patriots comeback to brighten up a Sunday afternoon.
GB ain't in the playoffs
We can and we will. 
Lol get out of here.
Literally nobody 
Stop being dumb.  He was being touched while he was being contacted by Lewis.  He would have be down by contact the second he got the ball
Never count out Touchdown Tom
Sad!
Lol, okay
That's cute 
GOAT BRADY
Still awesome?
Suck it Jalen you PRick
Aw yeahh
Itâ€™s the New England mindset after the 1986 Red Sox. We get pissed and fire anyone who costs us a championship. 
No... there's been dynasties thru the history of the NFL and this is no different. I'd point to head injuries and the controversy over trivial things like the anthem, which is BS imo but people are crazy
OMG you guys, Tom Brady's going to the Super Bowl. I mean, you have to appreciate that. 
Go Vikes!!
Good game, Jags! You guys definitely are legit. 
It was down to the wire. 
Lol okay bub
That fire is what fuels brady to all these wins. You are feeding them your dark energy and my evil overlord coach appreciates it
sorry r/NFL, WE GOT AWAY WITH IT AGAIN
Hahahahahahaha yâ€™all downvoted me to hell when I was calling for flags earlier in the game.
How could you watch that game and think that?
Vikings yes, iggles maybe, gotta see how they play v the vikes
At least there actually is parity, just not when it comes to the pats ;)
I need to rewatch it, I thought he touched down.
Me.
Come again?
I said that, though :p
HARVEST THE SALT, BOYS.
I hope Gronk's concussion isn't too bad.
You seem mad.
"Just got out of the shower boys.

OH NICE! "
Jags made it a GAME. You have to give the Pats credit for their tenacity, but Jacksonville legit had me scared as hell for the first three quarters.
DOOOOOOO FALLLLLLLLLL
Hell ya man, I hope you guys get to play at home for a SB, that shit is amazing story time stuff.
Ugh, the patriots are so boring :)
I do, FWIW. Vikings remind me of 2001-2002 upstart Patriots beating the greatest show on turf.
Lol
fuck you for losing last week!
WE'RE GOING TO THE SUPERBOWLLLLLLLL!!!! WOOOOOHOOO SUCK IT BITCHES I'VE BEEN RESPECTFULL ALL GAME AND YOU CLOWNS KEEP ATTACKING US! KISS THE RINGS!!!!
Good try guys. Better luck next year ;)
LET'S FUCKING GO!
GG Jacksonville, you guys were incredible, what a game for Danny and Tom
Me.
Yes all the tears are delicious
See what Iâ€™m saying about those chickens?
here comes the salt
He was legit trash at the beginning and we saw him improve every game. Would much rather have him than Butler at this point that's for sure.
ðŸ™‹â€â™‚ï¸
Us.
"Are the Pats to the NFL what Alabama is to college football?

Because I hate those fuckers winning all the time. But I love my Pats. "
I'm terrified of the Vikings, just like how I was with the Jags. The Eagles could go either way depending on how Foles plays
Me
Me.  :)
Do you disagree with the Pi and the unnecessary roughness?  
Woo.
Hopefully the bias will die down after the heat of the game ends.
But take a look at the fact that having a 190 lb man hanging onto you and dragging you in a different direction would cause somebody to not run at full speed...
Feel bad for the Jags players, they are devastated
Patriots fans
I kinda do
If only they'd called DPI on Gilmore on that last play the Jags could've had a million billion points easily.
We do I just don't know the comment number threshold. 
Enjoy the offseason 
I canâ€™t hear you from all the way over here in the Super Bowl.
Haters gunna hate. Patriots gunna win. 
Vikings tbh. They deserve it.
I just hope Gronk is ok 
Cry me a fucking river, baby. Those 3 big calls were legit af and there was nothing blatant that NE "got away with".
Feel bad for Bortles. Good game Jags bros. 
"Honestly:  I fucking hate the taking a knee with 1:30 left.  Its a bullshit cheap way of winning.

There should be a rule that you have to move the ball until there is 0:30 left or some shit."
This game is why Belichick is the true GOAT. Brady is great, no doubt, but regularly beating better teams is all up to coaching.
Lol...always a few that blame the refs. 
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘Œ
I beg to differ.
All that shit talking all game long, congrats ya losers. 
Ha, salty bitch. Sucks to be you, Pats still beat the Jags. SIX RINGS!
ABSOLUTE GOAT
Pats v Vikings please!
Both sides of the ball, both teams, coaching, special teams, commentators. That was one of the best football games I've ever seen. 
FADE THEM
Push off Lmao he literally dove without a hair touching 
/r/NFL on suicide watch
That's because he is a true football fan and has every reason to be.
I'm not sure we deserved to win that, but I'll take it. Hell of a season, Jacksonville. Looking forward to what you do next year. What a great young team!
Man I did not want to see the Jags in this game at all. That team is so damn scary. Defense is just stupid fast. 
I understand. We have some shitty fans, but all fanbases do.
edgy
DILLY DILLY!
You mean the pre-Belichik/Brady era?  Yeah, a lot of us >30 remember those days.  We prefer not to return to them.
in all seriousness, it was a great game. I love you/r/nfl. it's definitely a love/hate relationship. Great game, looking forward to vikings and eagles
As someone rooting for the Pats, I thought Bortles played great. They just got worn down.
Never doubt the fucking GOAT
Win the game = puss out!
Beat them if you don't want the Patriots to be in the Super Bowl.
Come on, now. That had a "sponsored by Unity Game Engine" at the bottom right corner.
"...me.

But even a large part of me wanted to see Bortles in the Super Bowl"
Great game jags. I havenâ€™t clenched this hard since last February but in all seriousness that was a hell of a game by the jags I did not expect this outcome. 
Great fucking season Jags. Hell of a showing today.
I mean, not like I'm upset with the result
S A L T
Salt. Accept it, you lost. 
Salty downvotes are salty
now all you pansies can cry refs you losers. Don't doubt the goat
who gonna doubt us???
Youâ€™re god damn right
gg
cry more
People hating on Romo shows just how stupid all the hate in this thread is.
"Fuck everyone... 

Go Pats..Lets go Tom Brady. G.O.A.T"
Bruh
lmao nice prediction Jalen
nah we know :D
Eric Rowe
Chill m8 we won lol
Why? Your next coach is in it.
Just another jealous Toronto Bills fan. It must really grind on you every time someone asks you where you are from and you say New York, they reply, "Oh, I love the city," and you have to explain you are actually from Buffalo... 
I legit thought Jacksonville were losing the entire 2nd half
FADE THEM JAGS!!!!!!!!
lol
Thanks buddy!
"Congratulations on an amazing season to all of the Jaguars! What a fantastic year. They should all be proud. Had they won, I would've been proud to switch to the Jags bandwagon flair.

Oh, but fuck you Coughlin! You have no power here anymore!"
What channel is the NFC game on?
You just can't beat the GOAT
Agreed!
Yeah refs carried the team to 13-3 and the number 1 seed. And they definitely carried the team to the divisional and conference win. In fact TB12's entire career has been bullshit and add BB too. Entirely the refs throughout his career.  
Meh
Counting penalties called doesn't make a valid argument.  It's possible one team simply committed more penalties.
Yeah too much of a fan sometimes, but I like the enthusiasm
I checked it. What's the issue?
Seems like they adjusted and executed.  Color me surprised.
The  spotty cats played amazing football and I enjoyed the heck out of watching them in the postseason.  Next year...
Denver has been to 2 of the last 5. 
Cuz concussing our superstar TE is not cool.
I'm just here for the salt.
Lol triggered much?
Happily
Hey we won! 
No u
Nah he's gone to HC the Vikes in a while, rip
You're a miserable human being
[Well](https://media.giphy.com/media/26ufhjIgZW1wJL9pS/giphy.gif)
Didn't even have Gronk and Edelman.
Or ya know, your team that couldn't maintain their composure.
Lol
LOL dude. He was trash in like the first 5 games but he's been AWESOME since. He's our best corner for sure. 
Hey we won. 
Ok
let the salt begin
Fucking waaaaaa!  Took our number 1 receiver out of the game with a dirty fucking hit.  Have fun golfing.
Every team has those fans 
Lol
Hey turd we won 
Goliath wins!
Pure class! Wishing death over a sport. 
I donâ€™t think so, but I can understand the rest of the league thinking that way. 
The amount of salt in this thread all game makes the win so much sweeter.
I'm taking this for copy pasta

They'll be talking shit on the plane ride home too
GOODELLY GOODELLY!
Why?  Just root against us.
Abso-fucking-lutely. Are you upset with how it turned out?
The NFL needs better coaches.
No you see, we always cheat, that's the only way.
To have an MJ flu game? I'm in
"Didn't like seeing Bortles or Fournette that torn up. 

Gg guys, I should leave Reddit for a while tho. "
Couldn't hear you over the sound of the crowd noise.  Turn down the volume and try again.
GREATEST DYNASTY OF ALL TIME 
GOAT is too good. Too bad weâ€™ll suck once he retires.
Hahaha wow. So fucking spoiled. Brady the GOAT, Gilmore way to earn your contract, Amendola with that catch, Lewis with the amazing moves to seal it.
seriously what do you think is happening besides being tired of the patriots winning again.
Gg
Like it would stop him...
welp... they should have gotten them
Yeah that was a bad move I didn't understanx
He has been so far for us this year
Defender was already down though.
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
a little much to wish the death of a bunch of people... its just a game man.
I am here for the salt and excuse making. 
Maybe the NFL should conspire against the patriots and suspend Brady for a bunch of games so that they don't win the Super Bowl....oh...wait.
Why?
Thank you
R/NFL MELTDOWN AFTER PATS WIN 10/10
well considering all the hate, yes.
Woot-woot!!
"Jax.


JUST ANOTHER BUNCH OF AVERAGE GUYS, COMING UP TO NEW ENGLAND  THINKING THEY'RE SPECIAL, GETTING AN EDUCATION...

"
JAX fans were talking shit all game. Them and everyone here without pats flair 
Lol stay salty
The fanbases of 30 other teams shit on us at all times and you expect us to do what? Stay quiet when our team runs the table? Not likely
"Just because you want it to be bull shit doesn't mean it is. Sorry maybe next time friendo.


Concentrate on beating the eagles and less about the patriots lol"
True. That was a good battle and the Jags put up a really good fight. Respect.
You right the commissioner that actively tried to sabotage our QB is fixing games for us to win the superbowl
They had to.  He was down by contact.
Yeah, almost every week that happens
[It feels good](https://giphy.com/gifs/seinfeld-Uub4sFbAjU9Mc)
Reminds me of a team from the state just North of their state...
Good thing tom doesn't cheat :)
"Literally already filed my state and federal taxes.

With turbotax.

Paid $0."
"I hope you get stuck on Dale Mabry at 5:15pm just south of Carrolwood

Edit: Going north.

Edit2: On a Friday."
Both the Eagles and Vikings are better than the Jaguars.
GOAT doing GOAT things
I canâ€™t get over the lack of Ravens in the playoffs this year. Unbelievable.
BE INTRLLECTUALLY HONEST AND GIVE CREDIT TO THE BEST QB AND COACH YOU WILL EVER HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING. BRADY BAILED YHE WHOLE TEAM OUT. BUT YOU GO BACK TO BLAMING REFS FOE YOUR SHITTY TEAMS. .. to the people who do give respect.. papabless 
Should we be bored by it? Should we not care. Shut the hell up, every fucking time we go feels great.
THE DYNASTY CONTINUES BOYS
Flair checks out.
Your owner has a bowl cut and is moving your team. 
"Where were you when Jaguar dies?  
I was at home drinking Dunkin when Bill call.    
""Bortles is kill""  
Yes."
If it makes you feel better,  the chiefs ruined the patriots perfect season bid this year. 
Ah, I see, hard to sync up comments to game action sometimes, just seemed like a more general statement.
Yup. Six rings!
Salt is one of the most common elements when combined with liquid water. Human tears contain salt. Tom Brady sustains himself on the tears of fans from lesser fanbases
You do realize that penalty totals do not have to be even and that making the right calls is not wrong. 
?
Yeah I'm not an optimistic person
Nah
Jax played not to lose.  Deserved what they got. 
Yeah because all of the Super Bowls the patriots have played in have been really boring games...
Sit down 
I almost did but it turns out I'm going to be okay. Thank you for your concern!
ðŸ 
SUPERBOWL RINGS ARE BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
"Yeah yeah, I'm sure that's why they've been the best team for 2 decades.

Get the fuck out"
Literally everywhere at the moment
I did, fucking took amazing coaching and a goat to win it with 3 min to go
I hope you learned english
"People say that about every play that doesn't go the way they prefer.

Learn the meaning of ""blatant"""
"Jags your defense is amazing, what a great game. Hope those injuries at the end arent too serious 
"
I know, I instantly told my girlfriend Pats just won the game when that happened. Turns out I was right
Bye Felicia 
SALTY BOI
The hate within the AFC south never ceases to amaze me. Y'all brutalize each other in a manner that I really respect.
LOL yeah you seem really neutral dude
Mhm stay salty ;)
I'm so spoiled
You my friend are a special kind of shit 
":(

Thatâ€™s you ^"
Lets go Eagles! Cuz fuck I don't wanna play the Vikings D(the actual best defense in the league). 
so sick of us it affected your spelling ability.
Thugs
I'm questioning why this guy is saying that... Ramsey and Fournette are both better
I do believe that is an incorrect statement. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0
"Obviously Iâ€™m ecstatic, but I have to say- great game Jags. I can say with confidence that you guys are one of the few teams in the AFC who I wouldnâ€™t have been salty about losing to. Youâ€™re just so fucking likeable.


You guys had a great year, you were a blast to watch, youâ€™re young, youâ€™re funny, you had an amazing bortlessance as he finally hit his stride in a truly veteran way even as everyone kept hating on him, and best of all you embarrassed the Steelers twice.



You guys are great, and playing you guys made me sick for 3 quarters. I look forward to seeing yâ€™all in the playoffs next year.


GG


Edit: lmao downvotes. Idgaf I still like you guys. I wish you nothing but the best next year."
Lol ok. 
"I will always root for my hometown pats and I'm ecstatic about the win.

But DAMN, my elementary school self -- who was easily wooed by flashy teal uniforms and apex predators -- is kinda sad it came against the Jags."
Cause seeing Bortles in the Super Bowl is entertainment? 
I grew up in New Hampshire, I lived in Boston for 10 years. I spent the first 30 years of my life in New England and am 31. I use my horn liberally in traffic and gesticulate wildly. I will shit talk you into the ground. I was born during a Nor'easter. I fucking am New England. 
He was nervous; it was his first conference championship
That play calling by their offense did them no favors. They were killing with screens in the first quarter and then decided to just run it up the middle for 1-2 yards the rest of the game. 
THANK YOU. I think everyone is just tired of seeing us all the time, but itâ€™s always a good game.
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcz_kDCBTBk
"
good
"I could retire on the mineral rights to all the salt in this thread. Thpthpthp. 

Amazing game by Bortles, though, and I'm stoked to see how the Jags do next year."
wow a gay joke from a 49ers fan
"He was pretty happy during a post-game interview after the Super Bowl last season.

https://youtu.be/RKIfU1-gyYU?t=199"
 If only I had the energy to call out the pats â€œfansâ€ that thought the game was over at 14-3 
That's hysterical comment from a Cowboys fan. You were us twenty years ago.
Great Game Jacksonville, you have a lot to be proud of! The game today was a war!
Its sort of like going to the store to pick up some milk for us now.
Just started watching football but thinks their smarter then the professionals 
don't have to be so salty jeez
Ur next ;) 
So much salt. Fucking love it 
Yes lol 
Brady really hurt his hand getting a 6th ring finger installed
It's a good city tbh 
"The salt sustains me.
 This thread is perfect lololol"
I know this is easy to say but he's got a TON to be proud of this year. No one expected them in the playoffs let alone championship game.
Yeah, that was a really hard-fought battle. Respect to the Jags.
I meant pizza since you mentioned Pizza Hut haha
Biases aside. Has there been a Pats superbowl not including getting beat on by the bears that hasn't been a fantastic game?
Waaaaaa,  go fuck a snowman you buffalo wing eating dip shit.  HahahahHa
Better luck next year lololol 
"#LMAOOOO

Only person who bailed us out was Tom Fucking Brady. Did you even watch the game?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcz_kDCBTBk"
Down by contact. 
We don't deserve Tom Brady
"Yeah without Bortles, what is the point?
/s I get it though"
Thats alright, our owner doesnt touch people inappropriately. 
"cry harder

im still jizzing"
That's pretty vague, any specifics?
Want some cheese with that wine?
Time for you haters to apply the cold water to the burned area and appreciate true greatness.
Belechick and Patricia hugging was all the feels. 
You guys are going to suck donkey's balls against Philly. Even if you win, Brady will fuck you up in SB. 
IDK, if you go to live itâ€™s 90% people shitting on the Pats...
careful now, weâ€™re about to gift you Andrew Luckâ€™s savior
*10th
Let the hate flow through you
get your tinfoil hats on
Yeah shits sad
Disciplined units
It's treason then 
I don't know why people are surprised Pats fans get rowdy when 31 teams are constantly telling them how much they hate them. 
I wish I could invest in salt right now.
What a fucking game.
"Lol. (One of the) most penalized team in the league all season commits penalties and it's a conspiracy. /r/NFL is surprised. You guys are legit hilarious.

Edited for accuracy. "
How about no
Thanks!
dont blame it on the PI. you guys played a great game. We just happen to have the greatest qb of all time. It was a great battle. Be proud of your team!
"bandwagon much? lol

"
"Holy shit @ the vitriol in r/NFL


Edit: As evidenced by the downvotes"
You gonna cry? Or you gonna thug it like your D at the end of the and try to fight on kneel downs?
I feel like the last point is the reason for the 2nd to last point.
Have some class
Agreed. GOAT keeps on GOATing
lol so much salt
Very high blood pressure from all the salt /r/nfl
Gooooooooooooooood!
Not if you're rooting for them. 
Like on the deep throw directly into the arms of Cooks while his arm was pinned by the DB and there was no call?
I love seeing all the salt
Whats that about? You guys got our future for a second round pick.
I think that's a hyperbole. I think a lot of the playcalling in the 2nd half would have been better to fault
HE WAS DOWN. HE WAS CONTACTING LEWIS'S BODY DURING THE STRIP. THERE IS NO UNIVERSE WHERE HE WAS NOT DOWN BY CONTACT, BOTH BODIES ARE TOUCHING WHILE ON THE GROUND. STOP BEING STUPID AND SALTY

"The evil empire strikes again

I better tell my pastor has wrong.. HATE FEELS GOOD!  HAHAHAHHA
We aren't playing the 2006 bears. 
But youâ€™re a Vikings fan, have you already given up?
gronk is like 6inches taller, you have to be aiming for his head to hit it.
Unfortunately, looks like itâ€™s going to be soon. TB and Bill are both creeping towards retirement.
Aww, go to bed boy its ok
Don't worry folks, this sort of thing will be over in 3 maybe 4 years, more years behind than in  front 
Both calls were good. You're blinded by hate.
lol ok keep hating buddy 
Which plays could have been flagged? 
Jacksonville lost composure. Blame the refs if you want but where was the pass rush in the second half?
No u
Cry more 
"i hope you guys win, playing a home team in the superbowl would be amazing

also i fell in love with the vikings last week"
Oh yes we can! Another 2 or 3 years at least
Lol
Hopefully never
Either put up some clips of plays that werenâ€™t called or shut up. So sick of hearing this whining after every game we play. The game was pretty clean for both sides other than the obvious calls they had to make against the Jags. 
Why do you have that bolt logo? 
Wins in the playoffs every year
Playing the injury "what if?" game is tough, but that team with all their 1's, no thanks
We were down 10
I do.
Who knew well coached teams played disciplined football? Shocking. Jags shot themselves in the foot. The delay of game after a timeout? Inexcusable. Just bad coaching. 
GG NO RE
Shouldn't have been a fumble
I accept it, I was just curious about the logic. At the very least, I would think people were excited to see us get so close and lose again
Time to dim the Jags flair.
Haha 5 of 6 analysts picked Jags to win!
#GOAT
You're going to despise them a lot more in a few weeks.
Soak it in brother. Soak it in :) 
That's pretty fucked up nah
I would
I really donâ€™t recall any non call situations. Didnâ€™t even see situations with the jags looking around for a call. The idea that you have to have penalties to prove the refs didnâ€™t favor you is infantile but, well, thatâ€™s kind of how the rest of the league is compared to the pats.
Perennial winning.
I guess. Would think people would be excited to see us choke or w/e
" you're clearly not neutral since you hoped patriots would lose and don't want them in the Superbowl. 


Look up the word neutral you clown"
Football isn't that serious, loser.
That's pretty standard practice...
James jones is a homer-loving-kind-a-guy. "Blake bortles outplayed tom brady". Yeah, too bad the game is not won by most yards u rodgers-loving homer.
Funny how every one of the dozens of close primetime games over the years, the Patriots get "gifted." I can't wait until they actually have to win a game without them being lucky or getting ref help. Maybe someday.
"Haha it's funny because insinuating ""the NFL is rigged"" is so hip right now!

Every respectable coach thanks the refs after working a game."
Like it or not Belichick is the smartest coach in the league and knows how to use players to his advantage. Great game for both teams.
Down 10 with no Gronk against top pass defense in the NFL. Incredible. 
Ya I hate competent football, too. 
Are you dumb or just stupid? He touches his back while flying through the air to swat it and that's it. Here it is so you can watch it over and over again and cry you pathetic fucking baby. Time for #6!!! https://streamable.com/e92vp

"
Keep going im almost there. I fucking love it. 
Flair up ya bitch. Probably an AFC West/South fan lol. 
Played too conservative towards the end. 
Dont forget to fade the Jags flair before you turn out the lights.
I do not get why some people are saying pats fans are the worst when we get shit on non stop here.
How do so many people believe this conspiracy theory BS. The game was fairly called, those PIs were blatant
Please. You guys got Jimmy G and have a huge amount of cap room. Football is going to be extremely fun for you next year
Theres already one on the web. Also very sorry you couldnt beat the Jags. We did. 
Pat's defense got so many stops to give TB12 a chance.  Both sides of Football win games
Yay
Drive for 6 baby. Just accept you spoke too soon ahaha
Youâ€™re safe now bb
Yea it shrunk into a mangina in that fourth quarter 
he was down by contact anyways. It was the right call. 
yeah the lions franchise has been boycotting the Super Bowl since they were founded.
I want drunk Robert Kraft again
Not watching the super bowl.

Yeah, like when one knee down Lewis was fumble, but two knees down WR from Jags was allowed to run. Or that hold on Hogan... damn. They really went against Jags.
GOAT gonna GOAT
Fuck you
Your coach has an IQ of 85 lol.
Not when you're a Pats fan ;)
I would
I'm putting you in my will. 
Your Super Bowls were barely won on a missed field goal and two fluke catches
I'm sure we'll do fine without you
Hey buddy good game!
Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.  Maybe not knowing you makes it easier to be dick to you.  But what I know, is the refs didnt win this game, your undisciplined defense and brady did.
Preach!
"I am quite happy. Brady is the goat is a given but to watch him each time is a joy.

Well played Jaguars. But they're no match for Brady.

Let's go......."
Umm, as a Panthers fan, shouldn't you know they didn't make the Super Bowl 2 years ago?
So when is the next ESPN hit piece?
did BB lose weight? He looks almost slim
Thanks for Harrison! He really helped us wrap it up.
Don't forget after they won last week. Sweet seeing them lose and the look on their faces!
It shouldn't have been a fumble.
Nah.  As a fan, I just think it is dumb.
BB: Who needs this fucking trophy
You should really get some help for that complex you have. Isn't healthy, man
Jags took out the Pats' best receiver with a dirty hit and still lost. Cry more.
salt salt salt salt salt
We all are. Letâ€™s ride the wave til the end ðŸ™ŒðŸ½
Wondering the same thing. Some people donâ€™t like football even if itâ€™s good though, just want to hate who they hate
Lol BB just handed that trophy like it was nothing
Huh?
And shout out to the Steelers for throwing out a perfectly functional pass-rusher who made some pretty big plays for us tonight. Couldnâ€™t have done it without you
*Celtics
HE'S LOADED LMAO
Nah I'm on mobile
Honestly Father Time has got them covered. It cannot last much longer, it is impossible.
not a just one, no.
"#FinishtheJob

Not that big into NBA but Celtics is who I root for, more into college Basketball
So salty
"And so did the Jags, such as a deep pass to Cooks where Ramsey held his arm back the entire time, and it was shown on replay, and no one said a word.

The only calls the Jags had were obvious penalties. They didn't even throw a flag after the Pats first TD when Jack threw a slap!"
I know, God forbid the fans enjoy it when their team wins. Go climb a pole. 
And the Giants can go back to playing golf!
Smug as fuck
Every time I see this comment I have to agree. No telling what would've happened, but I was happy for 3-4 possessions they did that deep in their own territory
Bill tossing the trophy
hehe
that's okay.  For the record though, I grew up in Boston.
Love it!
They thought Lewis was down?
I don't think so. Min & Phi both have stellar defenses. Min has a better offense than Jax and would have home field advantage. I don't feel super confident at the moment.
Hate us cuz they anus.
How?
Trueeee... Which play lol
hahaha
This never gets old.
Gotta balance out all the "omg NFL is rigged" whining on this sub
Dilly fucking dilly
Yeah those disciplined assholes
"Jaguars played well but also dirty. Still, great game by Jaguars.

On to Minnesota. Let's go."
"Nice narrative there

I'm imagine if we watch the tape, there will be holds on a majority of snaps on the trenches. There were also 2 big DPIs on Cooks not called on crucial 3rd down.

But no, let's look at only things that support our own world image"
What was biased about this one?
Do you hate NE more than other NY/tri-state teams? Like... Before this current run NE has had, it seems like you should loathe local teams, despite being in different conferences
no
Correction. he's been very, very good with us
Yeah no, let's have blowout wins instead
Come on!!
"3-step process: 
1. BB, with help of his coaches and the unrecognized genius of Ernie â€œPink Stripesâ€ Adams, makes every adjustment he needs to and outsmarts the other coach
2. Other coach pisses his pants and outsmarts himself
3. psycho Tom goes ballistic and pulls some wild moves out his butt"
Itâ€™s because weâ€™re good.
First positive comment I have seen from a non patriots fan, thank you
PI doesnâ€™t count towards passing yards
Iâ€™m making French fries
Will you?
BRARY
Easily? What about this win was easy?
Yeah.. youâ€™re right. Sorry, I got emotional after the game and felt like everyone was rooting against us. 
Translation- waaaaahhhh fucking waaaaahhhh the Pats are better than us. 
You. You are the problem. You justify the hate and salt and make the rest of us look bad
Your team couldn't finish the job even after injuring our best offensive player besides Brady
Love ya buddy. We all know what goes around comes around and weâ€™ll pay for this. 
Lmao bunch of salty bitches
Curious how you tbink the pats have cheated to get to the super bowl this season.
But we're enjoying it anyway.
It's funny that you think Brady hasn't already frozen all his eggs to ensure his genes can continue winning for centuries to come
Yesss.... Yess....
Monkey needs a hug
Here's a hint, guys: it's not the refs.
Breaking News: Salt futures up 1000%
Ball Don't Lie.
I didn't hear him say that, but he is an idiot.
"Back" to medocrity? In the last 20 years, when exactly?
No because it's obvious he was down by contact
The eagles by fucking far
Yeah because the Pats fans don't have to deal with the worst NFL fans all game every game. Constant rigged no matter what happens
A tackle isn't holding, baby girl ðŸ˜˜
How dare Pats fans celebrate the fact that their team is great. Grow up.
He was down by contact
Pathetic 
ya im sure its all about the penalties... get real. it was a great game
Lmaoo I absolutely love this
"lol you sound upset

btw, i grew up 20 minutes from pats stadium. seen every game since 2001, worked at gillette for 7 years, and went to the superbowl for free on the teams dime (SB49) and got an official superbowl ring

but im a bandwagoner? LOL. eat shit. youre just being a loser ass hater"
Because you canâ€™t hide Bortles forever
Don't commit penalties 
I really didn't understand why they did that. 
">Don't like it? Build a better team. 

That's too hard. Maybe the rest of the owners can conspire against the Pats and have Brady banned for a bunch of games for no reason. Oh...wait..."
The salt. Your team blew a huge lead. The game was yours.
I just love that this thread was 80% patriots hating for the first 3/4s of the game, now those people bitching that pats fans are insufferable 
"Eagles. Vikings match up very well against us, and I really don't want to play Minnesota at home.

Eagles are still going to be tough to beat, but that's the Super Bowl for you."
Cry harder. 
This guy gets it.  Thank you
Y'know there was a thread about this on the Patriots sub earlier.  What happened to the (evidently swiss cheese) best pass defense in the league?  Best defense overall?
Really? Damn you are salty.
So you come into a thread to whine and attack patriot fans, and we are the couches. Lol. Your stat doesn't even prove anything. Show me a missed call or am incorrect call. I have a feeling you won't be posting anything.
Iâ€™d rather watch goal line interceptions
Exactly. Bunch of salty ass bitches downvoting anything patriots related.
throw some bandwagon flair up, buddy
Sure, thats the reason. Look at you on your high horse.  "BLAH BLAH, this is why people hate you, BLAH BLAH BLAH.  WAHHHH."  I hope the stuffed animal you're hugging is adsorbent enough to handle your tears.  Enjoy your morals in your offseason.
[reading all the salt and excuse making in here](https://m.imgur.com/PHNTliI)
You do realize the Jags had #1 D in the NFL, right? Like, that isnâ€™t made up, it was a statistical fact lol
"it certainly does

its just funny to see the patriots kill peoples souls every january. its wonderful"
Let the salt flow 
I hate people who "hate most NE fans" and classify them as typically trashy people. That's pretty lame
We're watching a living legend. 
HAHAH, i dont have one, mind if I borrow yours?
It's a combination of the cold and the fact that he can't hear himself over the crowd
now Vikings will win against Eagles and doesn't matter who wins the super bowl everyone in Wisconsin (where I live) will be salty and I will be smiling.
Cliche, but that team is fucking spooky 
Dion Lewis and one other guy definitely touched him after he recovered the fumble and was lying on the ground. I'm not quite sure what the procedures are for declaring someone down; if you just have to touch someone with any body part or specifically a hand or something, but there were Patriots touching him after he had recovered on the ground.
Too soon man. I'm still getting over the 14 cup :(
Bortles went from 17-20 then finished 23-36... OG Bortles
GIVE ME ALL THE SALT!!!!!! MMMMMM YUMMY 
Both teams have played a great season, I'd say both teams have a fair chance of winning the game. I'd love to see Vikings go to th SB though, that way even if the pats lost, at least the Vikings won their first.
Love ya buddy!
"These kinds of threads, right after a game, are always filled with the absolute WORST people on r/nfl, giving their melodramatic crybaby posts, because they just can't accept that the Pats pulled out a game they were losing in, late, once again.

Give it a day or two and the more even keeled, fairminded people will dominate the conversation again.  Not these knee-jerk, hit and run bitches"
http://www.nflpenalties.com/penalty/offensive-holding?year=2017
I do
The sport is fucking *gushing* at the idea of Tom Brady being back in the Superbowl.. Fuck your Sheldon re-runs.
In all seriousness, for those of you convinced the NFL is rigged why do you even keep watching? 
me too thanks
"...Yes.

Jacksonville played an almost perfect game in all phases. Predictability on offense in the second half did them in when the Pats were finally able to get something going on their end. 

Anyone sleeping on the Jags going into today doesn't know football."
He always sounds plastered
They can downvote us, but our team is going to the SUPER BOWL
says a Ravens team that couldn't make it past Steelers that "Jags" beat LOL
I love Kraft post game speeches, he always sounds wrecked
Tom Brady is Jesus confirmed 
Awesome reference 
Maybe someone he knows got tickets?
"Yes the refs definitely fixed the game for the patriots

get over yourself"
See, no big deal.  
Original
I lold 
Why kneel at all? Run a few plays at least
So quit watching
His hand was never above his head. That's a kill signal to his own team. Happens 5 times in every game. I'm not sure what your complaining about
Kraftâ€™s default is plastered
You mean like how if a receiver is contacted before getting possession and hits the turf, you think he should be able to just get up and run into the end zone? Does nobody watch football anymore? This is such a non issue, if he is contacted and on the ground and he gains possession on the ground, he is down by contact, period end of story. Bitch about something reasonable at least like the first PI call, at least that was close.
Whats a Rev?
Our defense just doesn't play anywhere near as aggressively. It costs us yards in other ways. We get away with the same percentage as any team, our pool of stuff to get away with is just lower. 
How dare you... 
I have an Andy Katzenmoyer jersey. Does that answer your question?
He was born in the bay area but his mother and some of his family is from Minnesota
MUCH HUGS
He was down by making the turnover. All the time touching lewis with his body.
I don't think there are enough Patriot fans to upvote you, but you're fighting the good fight.
"> Sure, the refs, who work for a league that wants parody above anything else...

I want this to be intentional."

We gave you the second dreamiest man to ever live."
Belichick won't stand for penalties - do something stupid and he will bench your ass.
Come on man, lose with some class. The game was called correctly. The jack call was debateable but I believe called correctly. Other than that,there is no legitimate argument that the refs changed the outcome. You know that, and I know that. 
"I love the salt in here...Brady hurt hand.  Gronk out.  Many extra curricular hits after whistle by Jax...But the Refs handed this game to NE?  

How about the Delay of Game?  Predictable play calling?  Pats D stepping up?  Amendola stepping up?  nah...refs were on the take."
He wasnâ€™t touched because the refs whistles off the play and the pats players stopped because of that 
THE STEELERS PITCH IT ON FOURTH AND ONE. 
He said it and he's always talking about how much better rodgers is. Dislike him. Get out of television if you cant be unbiased.
thats not nice
Youâ€™re goddamn right we are!!!
"Why are they ruining football?  Because they're winning. Ergo you were not neutral. 


Walk away, save the little face you have lad"
"Jesus Christ how are you down voted for this post?

Oh.. wait your a pats fan. Got it. Grow the fuck up /r/NFL"
Only without my glasses.
"This is the first time Iâ€™ve upvoted a Jets flair.

What am I doing with my life?"
The salt is unreal 
I have no power over my football team haha. Iâ€™m just a guy who remembers when the Patsâ€™ starting QB was Hugh Millen and has been enjoying the last decade and a half of football. If itâ€™s the Eagles, best of luck to them! Might want to have them ask the Giants how to beat the Pats.
Eagles. The Vikings would have a home playoff game in the Superbowl and I think their D is better than the Eagles. That and I think Case can put the team on his back and I don't think Foles can. 
"> The PI was bullshit and the whistle that prevented the fumble recovery touchdown was TOTAL bullshit.

I'm not talking about either of those. Thanks for the personal attack though.

I was talking about all the scum that swarmed the game thread screaming about the helmet hit. And no, the PI call wasn't bullshit, its a literal rule you can't push receivers out of bounds. 

The fumble recovery shouldn't have even been a fumble, as he was down with possession. "
Yes. 
Where has this been my whole life 
fournette can only do so much
Bill  accepts your challenge. 
Me too :)
Serious question, did the NBA ratings go down when the Bulls were dominating?
lmao keep doubting us itâ€™s not like this was their 5th straight postseason win or anything
What else do they have to do lol? In the salary cap era no less
gotta make the playoffs to have a chance lol
You got -12 DV. Nice job, but I got you beat at -26
I don't give a fuck.  These threads are the whiniest and most pathetic things to read. 
He was down by making the turnover. Do you not see his knee, elbow, chest, being touched by Lewis? 
"You mean when a bunch of ""extra-curricular activity"" was going on between the jags defenders and Dion Lewis after he was in the endzone, and then the refs trying to break it up but instead accidentally pulling apart celebrating team mates?

No, let's follow the narrative here"
"Yeah kinda, why in the flying fuck would the league want the Pats to win if them winning means ratings go down?

Edit: lmao he edited his question to exclude the ref thing"
Extremely tasty tbh
Cause legitimately nobody cares about Jacksonville other than the locals.  The jaguars have no history or stars, they are not compelling. The NFL also wants to move the franchise to London. As recently as last year there were stories about how hard it was to get people into the stadium.  Nantz has been calling pats games for years, he's probably a bit of a fan at this point. I don't get why it's a big deal if he emphasizes the team he has called games for for almost 2 decades over the Jags who have been relevant for all of 10 weeks in the past 2 decades. You just want to hear a homer anti-pats call cause you hate them. Guess what, going to need Joe Buck to call the game for that to happen.
Your honesty is appreciated.  
It was deleted for some reason, I had it open in another tab and it says [removed]
So is a team with the biggest media market going 3-13
One, this is the present, not the past. Two, I wasnâ€™t directing what I said solely towards salty jags fans, I was directing it towards the people downvoting me and other fans trying to shit on the pats and pats fans in this thread.
"Cooks for shoved our of bounds 20 yards downfield. What Iâ€™m saying is that you arenâ€™t going to get any benefit of the doubt when your team head hunts on the previous play. 

Gronks suspension has nothing to do with anything. This was a play on the field. "
It was unearthed on an ancient Sumerian tablet. Derived from the name Dil-lÃ©h Dil-lÃ©h, the patron god of lite beer.
That's seriously such a mean comment to make about someone who possibly is concussed. It's fine if you don't like the Patriots but have some fucking decency dude.
If only we could harness the power of Salt - then we could live off of r/nfl gameday threads when the Patriots win. 
Lol Green bay
Jags played very well and at moments had me sweating. I am sorry the result was not in your favor but think it is big for putting Jags on the map. Best to you next season.
"But...but my self-indulging narratives!"
"So we should just keep quiet when everyone else is bitching about ""another boring super bowl"" and how they are ""so sick of the refs handing them the game"". Every other comment is one or the other dude.

I saw a bunch of posts that got downvoted to oblivion when the person was just thanking the jags for a great game, the reason? Patriots flair."
Too bad downvotes donâ€™t dilute salt.
"lol say whatever you have to in order to make yourself feel better

my teams going to the superbowl. suck it bitch"
Gronk will now be spiking touchdown in the Super Bowl bitch. Now THATâ€™S karma.
So like a super bowl ring?
There was a holding penalty. It was declined 
Iâ€™m just laughing at these people that hate on the pats. Iâ€™m not throwing shit at any players or teams. Nothing classless about laughing at the haters. 
Game was well reffed. 
Sounds like your hypothetical sisters problem.  
I would argue almost every third party fanbase in this thread has been starting more shit than any patriots fan
"wanna know whats funny?

I own more superbowls rings than any actual player on the bills haha

i just worked there"
"LMAO /r/NFL is salty cuz their trash team isn't in the SUUUPER BOWWWWLLLLLLL

#LETS GO!! NOT DONE.

Ha!
You've got a bright future ahead of you. Good on ya.
Could it just be sweat though? Blake composed himself incredibly well during the game - on and off the field
Love everyone downvoting people with pats flair for no reason too. The hate is part of the fun.
Ill be enjoying superbowls for the next 3 years at least. You will be getting your joy from hoping the pats lose and trying to score karma in nfl gameday threads ðŸ˜‚ have a nice superbowl Sunday. I know i will 
I think itâ€™s hard to say who had control when they were on the ground, but someone was down either way, as they were both touching for a long time
Great game. Bortles surprised and impressed me.
If you think our fanbase is any worse than yours, you're wrong
Because when we win, everyone else shits on us and discredits the win. It works both ways
"I mean, it's not exactly irrational.  Nearly every single fan base in constantly anti-Patriots from like week 14 on once their team is out.  It's not a persecution complex if it's the reality.  

Same with Lebron, and Golden State, Alabama etc.  It's rather normal in sports honestly.  "
They both are terrible, unfortunately.
Like a pre-shaken soda or walking into a glass door?
You honestly think that the refs called every penalty they should have on the Jags, too?
Even though pats superbowls always come down to the wire. Unlike manning getting blown out by the seahawks.
Yeah the last few Pats SBs have been real snoozefests
*Edgy*
All I can think of when I talk about the ravens is the kicker misisng a kick and me laughing rolling on the floor for a playoff game. Keep talking boi

K 
Do you want teams to have the same number of penalty yards, or a correctly called game? Patriots have been on both sides of questionable calls, but I thought this game was called fairly
And Bengals fans are better?
I don't agree with that at all and I've been to each sports arena multiple times. Where are the reports of Jags fans having any issues? Look at philly right now, huge police issues all over the place before the game even starts, already arrested several people 
How, as a fan of the sport, can you downvote this.. 
"> at moments had me sweating.

lol yeah I was sweating for moments too and not for the first three and two-thirds quarters of the game.

But wow, what a fucking game. gg jags."
Agreed, I had people posting on Facebook that they were shutting the game off because we were 10 down and we lost gronk... So annoying. Just shutup and try to enjoy the stress of the game.
got a higher win percentage against the AFC north than the east in the brady - belichick era my dude.
Hate you too bro! ðŸ¤—
"I call out opposing teams' fans for saying ""refs rigged the game"" and I'll call this comment out also.

It's an easy thing to say ""awfully convenient to take out the best offensive weapon early in the game"" but Gronk was going slightly down before the hit (i.e. not headhunting), and he didn't go for the knees. 

False narratives can go both ways."
"> It's well known Kraft pays the refs

[citation needed]"
Waaahhh! The refs!!!!! Waaahhh!!!!
It's not a complex if it's true.
Well when it comes to the Pats in the SB I do 
LOOOOOOOOOOL
I'm sorry but the rule states that an invalid fair catch is considered "invalid" when the player raises their arm above their head but the arm is flexed. I thought he had both of his hands horizontal to the ground? Did I miss that?
Was there any truth to that vikings and pats superbowl email leak from the nfl?
"Yes. Pats fans are no worse than other fans. You eagerly look for reasons to hate us.

Confirmation bias. People like you are similar to anti vaxxers"
"Patriots superbowls are so boring"... Last year's superbowl was the most amazing game I've ever watched. So if you're going to not watch just because the Patriots are in it, it's your loss. Be a fan of the sport for fuck sake. 
*Edgy*
Lol according to some fucking nobody. Sit down and watch my team play in the next Super Bowl kid. 
We aren't all like that. Don't paint with broad strokes
Seventh is pretty loaded way of saying 25th out of 32. 
Walk. Away. 
Soo gonna revisit this comment?
That's a really pathetic thing to say.
To be fair you have to have very high football iq to be a pats fan and to troll ravens fans
Yeah, great game. If Bortles got just a bit more on that 4th down pass, Dede had a TD.
"putting teams under pressure on the last half is part of the mental part of the game and nobody but belichick is the best at it. there is no luck but preparation for those situations. which your coaches failed to do for your kicker on that example. or the steelers example you brought up, or the seahawks superbowl play example we intercept, or the comeback against hte falcons. want more? 

It's a physical game but a chess match between coaches as well. "
You mean how many fans started watching *15 years ago*? I'd wager there are a ton of Steelers fans along the same page after Colbert drafted Big Ben in 2004
Show us the missed calls? The fumble is debateable. Agreedz but there was really nothing else sketchy. Show me if there was
"Seriously? We were down for most of the game. Objectively that was a really good game. 

Have fun in the salt mines!!"
Its the only way we can feel alive anymore.
Which is it: Pats going to another Super Bowl is bad for the ratings? Or the refs helped them win because the Pats in another Super Bowl is goof for the ratings?
BRO! I DID IT!  YAY!
"Literally nobody? All of New England would beg to differ.

And dude I get youâ€™re salty but youâ€™re downright delusional if you think the media is on the Patriots side. They cover them because theyâ€™re good, everything else is sensationalized and geared toward people like you, that will hate no matter what and eat up any story so long as it hints at trouble or cheating or deflating or whatever else sorry excuse they can come up with next time."
Yeah like your teams never had the "refs handed them that game" thrown in their faces before. No, of course not - let's continue to live in our false narratives that makes going to sleep easier.
They probably made 4 for every possible matchup early and accidentally leaked one of them.
Great game  to the Jags. You guys have a bright future!
"Obviously I'm biased. But some of these reactions are just ridiculous. 

We're a farce of a team?"
Yeah everybody watch the Seahawks-Broncos and Carolina-Broncos game to the last minute
Iâ€™ll hit you up for the dash of salt on my next clam chowder dish
It wasnâ€™t a fumble, ball wasnâ€™t out, pinned against his hip when Lewis hit the ground. They got lucky when the ref made the wrong call and NY didnâ€™t over turn.
I don't actually think I made any points, but you're right.  The game had a TON of terrible missed calls in the Pats favor.  Doesn't give anyone an excuse to act shitty though.
"I see Coughlin's culture is setting root there. 

There wasn't a word of ""we're glad to have made it this far"" or ""playing with house money"" all post-season. "
An easy comeback is not an easy win. Makes no sense whatsoever. Youâ€™re saying it yourself, they had to come back to win.
lmao you tryna say the ravens are a better franchise than the pats?
Yeah I just think possession is such a mess this year itâ€™s hard to say either way. I honestly donâ€™t even think it should have been a fumble but who can be sure anymore
Thanks? Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not
oops
"Lmao. This is the stuff, keep it coming.

Who are the one that need a life? The ones happy their team won and just laughing at how goddamn salty everyone else is, or the ones that- because their own sorry teams arenâ€™t in the playoffs- have nothing better to do than to hate on another team and their fans.? Youâ€™re sad.

But please continue, we love it. "
You mean where I accurately summarize a thread full of people complaining because my team won a game? 
"Is the van being driven by the saltiest motherfucking 49ers fan even after we got you guys your franchises quarterback for years to come?

"Dude. Did you not watch the game? What did the refs do?

It was all GOAT (Brady) and Amendola and Lewis plus Gilmore and defense and offense.

You may hate the Patriots but you cannot put Brady down. That is simply not right. And you know it."
The one when he was draped over Cooks without looking back?
Mad cuz u won't be? lol
Turned out alright
The hit on Gronk was unfair tbh. Plus a few more dirty plays
LOL
He made the defense honest. If Patricia/Belichick didn't respect him as an RB as much, we would have dropped into coverage and rushed the QB on 80% of the snaps.
"Says the guy who watches WWE LOL.

The ball never left his hand. Sure it shifted but his hand was on it the entire time.
Just hire shorter supporting cast to make him look taller. Problem solved.
"The same NFL that vilified Brady and heavily penalized the Pats by ignoring the laws of science? Lol okay.

Lend me some of your salt, our roads need it today."
The shouldn't be doing them any favors. They didn't do the pats any favors either. I just want to see some replays of missed calls. It's not a lot to ask more. Either provide evidence or be dismissed. I'm not even trying to be a homer. Pretend like I am someone who didn't see the game. You can do better than just repeating that the pats had nothing called against them. 
Itâ€™s already on pornhub!
"Im ok with htat :D
"
I mean, the ball never even left his hand. It just shifted. Usually with a fumble the ball pops into the air.
"anyways.

I don't really care about impressing randos on the internet. People can hate or love the Pats and i dont give a rats ass.

Reddit is a place to shitpost so im just doing my job"
Not gonna down vote, but be humble, that's the Patriot way.
Well, you're a Jets fan. You're gonna feel shitty no matter what Pats fans do tbh.
The truth is, the Pats time is coming to an end in 2 or 3 years and then they'll be another team to hate. Although, I don't think we ever see anything like the Pats consistently for a while - if ever.
I did actually!  I owned a Bledsoe jersey as a kid, I promise not all of us are bandwagoners.
You guys have a damn good team. You'll be contenders next year for sure.
"i see. thats awesome. his intro was the fucking best.

you're welcome

and you're welcome. He's one hell of a fucking coach (as u saw tonight.. and the entire season.. and SB51.. etc). Hopefully he's as great of a head coach as he is a DC."
Lol sure
Thank you. respect
Keep being salty af dude
Yes. Let the hate flow through you.
"I'm sure there will be.

Also, I'm not sure what's so bad about bandwagon fans. Sure, we'd all love it if our fans were as loyal as - say - the Bills. But honestly, I'd rather bandwagoners than nobody caring about the team when they ARE successful.

Nothing personal meant here, but would you say all Steelers fans follow the Penguins or the Pirates through thick and thin as well? I can surely say a good percent of Pats fans don't watch the Sox, the C's, and/or the Bruins."
"are you positive? are you positive you're not having flashbacks? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viSwWa3ohQA

btw, i find it hilarious you're saying pats are the trashiest organization in sports when the general consensus is that the Eagles are. There's no dirtier and trashiest place where people climb up street light poles in all sports than the Philadelphia Eagles lol"
I'm sorry your owner, coach and team are all piles of garbage. 
"Ok. Better than hoping and dreaming fir one super win in places like Atlanta or Detroit. Or hanging on to one win like Tampa or Seattle.

"Coming from a Packers fan? A quarter of your deep down plays come from Rogers getting a high reward-no risk play. 

Hell, Do you not remember that Hail Mary against the lions? That was the weakest facemask ever. The defensive end got penalized for being too strong and his thumb slightly grazing the facemask. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmBgptnhP9E) You can see that Rodgers doesn't wear the correct chin strap with four buckles. 

In the Novmember matchup against the Dolphins Suh had a real facemask  on Deion Lewis with full arm extension in the middle of the field.  Was there a facemask called? No The refs can't call everything. 

The Packers are just as favored by the refs as the Pats if not more. They along with the Cowboys and Steelers are the golden franchises of the NFL. The Pats will come back down to Earth after Brady and Belichick leave the League. 

TL:DR; The Packers get just as many calls.  You know who doesn't the Lions. "
I don't think I can ever give a fully unbiased answer through my tinted glasses. Unless I'm being sat down and pointed through frame-by-frame with the rule book, I'd doubt my impartiality.
You can't even try to show evidence or come up with anything better than that? Pathetic. Come up with something real if ou wanna talk trash! 
"I think BB is definitely an influencer and the main guy in play, but that doesn't take away anything away from Patricia I don't think. I mean look at Bill O Brien. He was solid with us and he's pretty solid at Houston. So we'll see. But then again look at Josh McD, he was solid with us, bad at Denver, and solid with us again because he got #12 

and thank you. I'm a shitposter and im generally way more humble in person. but this is reddit, the gold mine of shitposting and anonymity so i just dont care lol"
First thing you've said, that's right, all day.
You've made a lot of claims...they aren't valid just because you said they are. That's my point. There is so much whining going on but no one will actually defend their point of view.
The one penalty against NE was a holding call. 
"â€œYou okay, Gronk?â€

#â€FINLAND!â€"
But the previous contact is not negated. 
"I donâ€™t know how young you are - maybe youâ€™re my age, I donâ€™t know. But I do remember a time when the Patriots were terrible, and when they were basically just the answer to a trivia question - â€œwho did the â€˜85 Bears beat in the Super Bowl?â€ I remember being irrelevant.

Let me ask you this - if next season the Jets won the Super Bowl, and then won it the season after that, and then two seasons later again - would it still be fun to watch them? What if they won at least 10 games every year for over a decade and a half? I suspect if youâ€™re honest, you know it would still be fun. Itâ€™s fun to watch your team win, no matter how often it happens.

One day the Patriots will be bad again. They may even be bad for awhile. I have a toddler now, and I realize that by the time heâ€™s old enough to understand football, the Pats may very well be bad again. But at least I will have all these memories to fall back on, and I will be happy for that. I will remember how much fun this was."
Love you, baby cakes.
"> Plus The Lions have a good Defence of core

Oh yeah. I had them on fantasy and they bailed me out multiple weeks. what was it up until week 4 or something like that they had a TD on defense in every game lol. but yeah defense wins games (unless ur playing Tom Brady) so it should be interesting next year for you guys. Pair up Stafford with that defense and you guys should be good if the trash ass Packers are shit again next year lol"

"So I should let assholes ruin the subreddit for me?

Apparently pats fans have a ""persecution complex "" when people will say shit like this implying we shouldn't get to enjoy reddit"
"This is why I come to r/nfl. To see grown men throw tantrums over a legendary team, coach, and player continue to win and prove critics like yourself wrong over and over and over... And over again. You don't care about the Pats fans, you just hate seeing someone else win. 

 If you want every team to win once every 30 years so it's nice and fair I suggest you write to the commissioner so he can force whatever garage team you ""root"" for to win just once so you can drink a few extra bud lights in whatever crap city you live in that doesn't care about sports. Leave winning to the legends and fans who actually enjoy watching them and can truly appreciate these times.

Thanks for correcting on ""for"". Call us when your team can make the conference championship or super bowl four times, otherwise stick to checking your teams record instead of someone's spelling. "
Examples?
"That still doesn't prove it me a hold. He would have to grab him there. It looked like he disengaged at that point in game. 

Regardless, you guys have a bright future. Tough end for you, but you'll be back. Pretty likeable team too, although they were getting a bit shove with the pat today lol "
Honest question. Do you really think it was a fumble? And before you answer think about if we were talking about possession using the rules we use for determining a catch--because it's the same thing. He has the ball pressed against his leg when his knees hit the ground.  By rule that is possession and down by contact.  
Your defense was in the bottom half of the league. One defensive coordinator won't fix that. 
Eh, without Bill and TB weâ€™ll be average. No good QB to replace him. And Bill is also a GOAT, along with TB.
Here's me reminding you ;)
Nothing controversial happened lol
Back then, the NBA payoffs was usually the best thing on TV. Cable wasn't great and all the network shows were in reruns. 
Everyone who leaves ne coaching positions don't succeed elsewhere, it's been proven. Bill o Brian has a losing record in Houston. Losing his qb wouldn't change that much.

Not really toxicity IMO. I was replying to an asshole by giving him a taste of his own medicine, not really the same.
Did it land in bounds on the same side of the field?
Pain and Gain!
To be fair, 2018 side by side, Wahlberg compares like a troll.
you're right, and Scotty Pippin should have probably been the star of Space Jam.^/s
" Fair enough. However, the way Rogers wears his helmet is super loose. There are multiple occurrences of him not even buckling his helmet. My favorite one happened in the NFC championship last year vs the Falcons.
"
Spot on. So many times we could have been smashed. So many times opposing teams have gotten comfortable.
Bad luck Jags. You've got a chance at creating something longlasting here. Let this be the launching pad.
I would argue that the third party fanbases have been way more salty than the awesome Jags fans in here.
The two aren't comparable. Gronks hit was among the dirtiest we've ever seen. Church's hit was head to head and rightfully a penalty, but it didn't look dirty. 
Yea, I'm not surprised that you don't understand. I can tell that's something you probably have to deal with pretty often! 
Except they ruled it a fumble when they could have ruled it down...
Why, because I called him a salty bitch when he was being one, and rubbed victory in his face because he was being salty? Ok, bud.
Lol, I don't even have anything to say to you. You can't even come up with anything to defend yourself. You have made up your mind. Whatever helps you sleep at night. 
I seem to remember a team trying to be as aggressive as possible and blowing a game too instead of just running out the clock and kicking a FG.
"https://streamable.com/5wr15

I literally cannot even believe this call..he never even lost contact with the ball

The more i watch it the more I cannot believe how easy of a call this was and how unbelievable it is that they got it wrong. Completely inexcusable 

The ball was knocked from the cradle to his leg but at no point during this play did he lose contact with the ball--let alone possession or control. Again, if the question were ""did he catch the ball?"" then nobody would have any question that he had possession when his knees hit. This really isn't different at all. Your bias is blinding you."
Thanks. I needed some more salt to rub it in all your wounds.
"you'll have all the justification to rub it in when the table eventually turn

unless you move"
*shrug* I disagree. If youâ€™re a nice person in general and reply to assholeness by being an asshole, overall you arenâ€™t an asshole. My take on it anyway, you *seem* like an asshole to me as well but I guess I canâ€™t tell
"Eh, you can respectfully call people out. Example:

â€œIMO, both of you guys are wrong here. Mindlessly insulting each other is pointless and doesnâ€™t help the situation.â€

Your comment had an overall asshole-y feel to it and didnâ€™t seem very respectful. So no, it isnâ€™t that as much as you want to believe it is"
Yea Jaguar fans have generally been great. Shit it would have been more civil if it was just Jags and Pats fans. 
Really well played by the jags. Bortles played a beautiful game, injuries caught up to the jags at the end of the game, and Bradys touch was Midas as usual.
I do, I just said that it made you *seem* like an asshole (which I emphasized) and I also said I could be wrong. So no logical contradiction there.
What do you think now? ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
Probably unload him to another team for a pick.
"> delay if game and the DPI on an uncatchable ball

That wasn't BS, that was literally not snapping the ball on time, and shoving someone out of bounds, which is illegal regardless of how ""catchable"" a ball is. 

> but you can't tell me after watching that entire game that it wasnt slanted in officiating favor if the Pats.

Yes, I can. 

>Had they gotten any calls for their penalties on offense or defense than I wouldn't even be mad

Yes, you would have. No matter the penalties people in this forum find ways to whine about the Patriots. Brady gets fewer roughing the passer calls per hit than any other QB in the league? ""Oh the refs obviously baby Brady"" whenever he DOES get a call. People invent realities in their heads because they're tired of the Pats winning 

>this just screams the NFL trying to boost ratings by not harshly officiating the only big market team left. 

If the NFL was trying to boost their ratings, why on fucking earth would they be raising up a team everyone is tired of winning, the same team that just over a year ago they invented a controversy to take away draft picks and their QB. How does that make any sense. 

Was their a fall start they didn't call? Something they missed?"
You would have had to gone through the 80s and 90s as a fan. Little late.
Yes.  That is a bad picture. Quality is too bad to see anything. Watch the video I posted. 
your telling me their isn't an NFL guy in NYC photoshopping pictures during the games???????? 
"Youâ€™re trying to make an argument that the refs fixed the game for the pats with 1 call. 

Itâ€™s a completely fair argument. You honestly think that they didnâ€™t miss any calls on the jags? Because that could completely equal out. Pats had some missed calls, but still WAY less than jags, while jags also had missed calls but because they committed so many more than the Pats some were bound to be called. "
He'd need like 10 inch platform shoes
Lol, first half made me drink far too much with classes starting up again tomorrow
It's really hard for you to understand that outside of Jags corners running into receivers and the one play where the Jags lineman sat on a man, they have swallowed the whistles 
I am and this entire thread was too 
I love you. I just read your whole rant to a room full of people and they are howling
Good argument!
Hot take
Fuck. Of course someone spoiled the ending of the movie in the youtube comments
But we gifted you your mini goat
You say youâ€™re older than me and follow up with â€œgo suck you sisters titsâ€. Gonna be hard to convince me youâ€™re not 13. 
worry about ur own team first, you guys are getting waxed. 
easy money!
Unless you've got a tiny door.
He wasn't fired, he left by his own choice. And I doubt they were celebrating, considering they were coming off a 9-7 season.
How did that go by the way? 
Hey, I'm sorry about what I said. Passion for the team got the best of me. Everybody deserves to have a chance to watch their home team play well. I wish you the best of luck in the future.
Possibly. Isn't he like a foot shorter than Brady?
Got 'em.
12 what? Shouldn't you be posting some gaming-new years post right about now?
Nevermind lol
Thatâ€™s not what a fair catch signal is. 
Told you 
Can't you just be happy that you fluked two Super Bowls over us with a handicapped quarterback?
"Apparently his grandfather - as Philip Phillips is Philip Phillips Jr

The Dad was like â€œboy do i hate my name and that sucked growing up - better put my son through that too!â€"
No problem. Have a good one
For the team, but I was talking about Brady.
Iâ€™m late but this is fucking hilarious 
I legitimately had a ten minute argument with my Mom over Christmas about Young Sheldon. In retrospect I made some pretty extreme analogies during that argument.
You alright man? You sound really upset.
Oh yes, LOL
How the fuck do you feel strongly enough about "Young Sheldon" to have a ten minute argument about it?
I let my emotions get away from me if I'm being totally honest.
We will eventually get around to nerfing them though
"So, what ever happened to your prediction of fucking up NE in MN? Life lesson bro. Never open your mouth before even playing the game. If MIN won, you can talk more trash, but now they got ass blasted, youâ€™re left with your open mouth, and youâ€™re going to get bunch of big dicks nutting into it. lol.
SKOL SUCKS!!!! SKOLOSER!!! Your team got SKOL FUCKED Nananana..nanananaa..hey hey hey..good bye! Close the door on the way out"

Fair point. Congrats by the way. See you in two weeks!
They're better at breaking tables, were better at winning football games. It's hard to say who the real winners are
72K wow
Lol
Woot! Bet your jealous the NFL always favors the Pats! Brady = GOAT
Why?
As should you
PJSalt
Salt always 
 Not as cool as the guy wishing cancer on someone because he wins football games. Stay classy.
"> 17 years

So yeah, like everyone else. Whatâ€™s one more year?"
omfg i spit out my beer
Both teams where quite a few analysts said they would beat the Patriots. And the Jags with the #1 Defense in the NFL. Bro go away.
Civility? In this sub? What a pleasant surprise!
What's the point in your comment?
Hey man, no shame really. Your team was a tough matchup. Bortles is for real.
"And you think youâ€™re not? 

Nice. "
Flair up you pussy ass crybaby 
Calls my home town and team shit, brags about beating us, repeatedly shits on us, yet Iâ€™m being an asshole for retaliating, because heâ€™s only â€œventingâ€. Ok. If you honestly think that, you have other problems.
Not hurt, but it definitely gives me a right to retaliate. You made it seem like he was only â€œventingâ€, when in reality he was doing so by giving my hometown and team a big â€œfuck you, you sucks, we still shit on you, eat my dickâ€
Except Wahlberg will probably quit halfway through.
Flair up missy if you're going to talk such weak shit, how else will people know which fan base you're making look salty, hypocritical, and delusional?
I'd say it still beats the shit out of 0-16, what do you think? 
"Can't say the same about you, since that ball is bouncing of the reciever thanks to butlers hit. He already had his hands on the ball pre butler contact.


But that doesn't fit your narrative. "
"Gronk paid his dues for his suspension. So because he did something shitty he should never get a call again? Thatâ€™s just throwing blinders on, plugging your ears and shouting about how much you dislike New England. Gronks suspension has nothing to do with a headshot in a game six weeks later against a team that wasnâ€™t involved. 

Whatever narrative youâ€™ve built in your head is pathetic. Not even the Bills were out to hurt him in their rematch game.

Sorry that Gronk got lit up on a blatant helmet to helmet hit and youâ€™re too blind to see that. Go look at the thread around the highlight of that hit and youâ€™ll see that youâ€™re in this insane minority of people. Most reasonable fans are debating whether it was intentional or an accident but nobody is talking about how he deserved it. 

Jesus. Itâ€™s a game. "
Lol, gotta hold on to something i guess. 
When a pats fan posts something like this it's always "WHY ARE ALL PATS FANS ASSHOLES"
"I watched the game, you didn't apparently. 

Keep your salt, it's entertaining. <3"
Alright buddy.
Maybe not so far away if Bortles plays this good next year. 
I don't recall any passes Bortles made that went end-over-end... look at the ball genius. 
"A horse collar is not just grabbing the pads, but the way in which you bring the person down while grabbing the pads. The rule is written poorly in the NFL, but I digress. The ball was tipped already. The DB can hit the receiver all he wants and there is no way any ref in any game is throwing a flag to penalize that ""horse collar"" or ""facemask"" in this situation. You're grasping for some excuse to justify blaming the refs and not take responsibility, but face the facts. The Jaguars played a good game but got beat by the better team. 

Now is your chance to resort to a few more inaccurate personal attacks. I'll wait. 

"
Or, if you prefer, Danny "Amen"dola
Humble in victory, humble in defeat.
"Good job providing no actual evidence. 

This is the leagues best reffing crew. They were letting them play. They didnâ€™t do minor little calls on BOTH sides. Tons of holding, hands to the face calls I can see on the jags that werenâ€™t called. Also A DPI on cooks where two defenders literally held his hands to his side, and many more. If you think they were just calling for the patriots youâ€™re an absolute moron. 

Edit; and you canâ€™t forget the egregious unsportsmanlike they didnâ€™t call on whoever suplexed white after his TD"
Fucking dead.
That logic doesn't check out over the last 5 years.
flair up
