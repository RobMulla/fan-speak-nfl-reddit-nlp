Give Brady the Jags O line and this game is so different. Zero time in the pocket this game so far. 
The jags d is getting to Brady right now. On that play he was expecting to get sacked long before he actually did
I mean you're talking about a QB that has played 18 years and one of them is against Tebow. 
Fuck McDaniels and Patricia. Good bye.
So trash 
Let's go Celtics 
Pats D needs to step the fuck up
He has he beat QBR this year after getting sacked. 
jax D very impressive
Yuck
Mobb Deep - brady is the shook one
We don't have enough fucking athletes on offense right now to deal with Brady's inaccuracy. Getting punkd by some JV team with speed. Jesus fucking christ 
We're getting bullied ffs
This is bullshit. Jags getting all calls. Refs are obviously paid off
STOP PLAYING 11 PERSONNEL
Friggin hell. Hey D, might need you to bail out the O here. And then offense maybe you can bail out the D later. Ir now. Whatever.
Yep. Heâ€™s seeing/hearing shit. 
Man we cannot get anything going. D is staying on the field too long.
The more he gets hit, the worse he does. It's the one thing that's always rattled him
How did this defense give up 40+ to anyone 
fade me 
They know our defensive weaknesses like a stalker ex-girlfriend knows your passwords.
Fuck Romo
Only two more TDs to 28-3
"I'm a big fan of the Tomb Raider reboot games.

This movie looks horrible however."
Yup.
Shouldn't that be a penalty hit in the back?
Oh nonono
Yeah, same scary thought I had
CHEESY BAD CHICK MOVIE
Uh oh. Brady is seeing ghosts again. He needs to get it under control
Wut? He was literally scrambling the second the ball was snapped. Are we watching the same game?
If we keep playing like this second half then thereâ€™s no chance in hell. 
Enjoy losing the second game today then :)
Fuck Patricia. Fuck McDaniels.
Lol, they are good, but that is simply not true
I remember thinking that when we lost to Sanchez at home like 7 years ago...
Add Sacksonville
I've learned that to never doubt the pats until the final whistle blows. Not looking good, but I have faith.
Nick Frost or not, No thank you new Tomb Raider movie
Im not worried 
Really did. He had a few half-seconds after the first step up 
why are a team's fans not asking for a penalty that hurts their team? 
Take a shot every time the announcers mention Brady's hand
I aint worried yet.
Yo - if we all know one thing, feeling yourself halfway through the second against the Pats up by 2 scores ends well. 
This has been a decent officiated game so far. That's about the only positive I can find here.
Is it just me is Alicia Vikander hotter as a bald cyborg?
Man, they are just winning the physicality battle. 
I have kept the faith with this team, and I still believe.  Let's go!
Boston has a lot of douchey sportswriters. Borges and Shaughnessy being two of the worst.
They're going to adjust in the second half. The problem is getting there not down too badly. This defense needs to step up.
hell yeah
Donâ€™t you guys just love Reddit therapists?
Spoken from the mouth of a true fan of a dumpster fire
"He has hit three different players dead in the hands (twice on 3rd down) and they have all been dropped. 

Brady is not the problem. Our third string RT and Solder failing to block 1-on-1 at LT is our problem. "
I've been scared of the Jags, you guys should too.
That came from a franchise of bad chick videos games
Well this is interesting
It's still the first half 
Never seen the patriots manhandled like this. What the fuck. Even against Atlanta it wasnâ€™t even that bad. This is just... madness 
It's 2007 Giants super bowl all over again.
Lol okay. Been a fan since I was 7 but I'm sure you're right 
Unsubscribe.
28-3
She's a perfect cast for the new game. 
So this is how the Empire ends...to thunderous Reddit applause.
Tom Coughlin has some kind of voodoo magic on us I swear
Spent it all on custom trophies.
Lol
Ashes with 5 SB banners bitch ðŸ˜‚
Denver 2016? Seattle 2014? Like ffs, stop acting like this is the greatest defense of all time
Whereâ€™s the people saying Jag D is shit at? 
dipping PB&J in anything is gross
I once saw a game where the Patriots came back from a 28-3 deficit, so I'm not counting them out yet.
You must not have watched many football games then. Heâ€™s lost Super Bowls because of exactly that...
I've seen him look like that before, he's usually a pretty bad sign
yeah. Denver, giants, and Baltimore have done it to us before. I mean it is the key to beating the pats. 
I think most of our fans will be able to admit the Jaguars played better
"The best coverage team in football getting to the QB consistently while rushing 4.

Also, the Pats patented turnstile defense"
That's not my dad! That's a cell phone!
That's on Patricia, they had 8 sacks against the Titans so there is clearly the talent there. If you can't fucking do anything to stop the run or get pressure, that is on you as the coordinator. Butler and Gilmore are doing their jobs.
Lol!
Broncos defense in 2015 went from just a pretty good squad to legendary D by winning the Superbowl. Jags need to do that to be remembered as an all-time squad, no one is going to forgive losing to Keenum or Foles (assuming they get there of course). 
Damn good, but still probably worse than Minnesota's
Yeah but they werenâ€™t cheesy
I am. Best offense is the world counts for nothing if your defense gets rolled every drive. Just ask Pitt.
That's how you beat ~~Brady~~ any pocket passer
Look at all these faded flairs in here calling the pats trash lol. 
except the Jags have a better QB.
Lol, seriously, have you been watching the game?  Jags getting some leeway on some no calls.  I'm not complaining, less flags the better, but your statement is pretty ignorant
Brady was really fucking concerned about the pass rush there
Yea
"A part of me wishes this game was on a neutral field.

As good as the Pats are at home, having a large portion of the crowd cheering against them seems to fuel their comebacks"
The pats just cant stop the run right now, D has gotta show up
I just want matt patricia to be a pallbearer at my funeral so he can let me down one last time
Happy cake day. Fuck you.
Is Falconing the new Clemsoning?
We mocked them for losing because all they were talking about was the Pats instead of Jacksonville.
Ha. 
No. You haven't.
Right? Grammys are looking good 
Dunno about those guys but I absolutely didn't want to face the jags for these reasons. 
"ITT thread: literally everyone shitting on the Pats

In every other thread: Why are pats fans so touchy ? "
Need a turnover or a quick 3 and out leading to at least a fg.
When Brady starts feeling the ghosts of a pass rush on plays where it isn't even there, it's a bad day.
" I wish I could insert the sips tea meme of how Iâ€™ve been telling people McDaniels is a â€œsystem coachâ€ not only does over think it at times, but heâ€™ll complete abandon the run when we get behind... regardless I took a pledge to this ship and Iâ€™m on it until it sinks... 

McDaniels is a joke though period. "
Difference being the Pats respect the Jags and can actually get their locker room in order. 
Also not Atlanta's offense
Iâ€™m impressed.
Pats shitting the bed so far
Is defense going to do anything this time?
we could have Garoppolo right now D:
Jealousy
How does Barry Sanders still look like he's 22
True but you can't teach speed and we have slow LBs
Hoping we can get to halftime without giving up another score and try to make some adjustments 
Too late for that. The chosen replacement is gone. Fuck it, Brady till he's 45
Struggling with the same thing. 
Ricky Jean, Brown, and Butler are going to have to step their games up.
He usually wears a glove on his left hand, his right hand ha tape on it.
Well I know that Patricia and McDaniels are going to fail as Head Coach's, so I'm currently laughing. 
NE D needs to stop the bleeding right here and now. 
The Danish Girl
absolutely. i just gave up on predicting The End though. 
A turnover on this drive would be nice 
and cover his receivers to the foot
Jimmy Baratheon 
"That is exactly what I am trying to do, lol.  I'll never say never again after 28-3, but obviously don't like this so far.
"
He was looking for the defender coming at him the whole time. He couldn't even look to throw it. 
How does Patricia have HC offers...
Jason Bourne 
ALRIGHT DEFENSE! Showing signs of life will go a long way.
Keep it the fuck up
The way people are talking you'd think so. 
Lmao you can hardly pin this on Brady. He's the only one who's doing anything on this team tight now, on either side of the ball.
Please don't run to the outside Jags
Not used to seeing Brady panic in the pocket like that 
I'm surprised with the double runs because they have been murdering us with the pass.
"Who's defense did we put in?

Edit fuck me i jinxed it"
We aren't
Do your job here secondary 
Anyone saying Brady is shook is just a casual or non-football fan. Heâ€™s not shook, the Jags defense is just killing it. Our run game is non existent, and they are riding the hip of all our receivers. Brady almost has 100 yards passing already... itâ€™s not like heâ€™s been shit.
Steelers Jags thread, â€œtheyâ€™re not so good, 400+ yards from Ben blah blahâ€ 
Everyone is covered.
He dodged four different pass rushers on that play...
Defensive just needs to make a stop here. The Jaguars D will lose some speed as the game goes on, just need to stay within range until then. Even a fg isn't terrible.
Need some defence up in this bitch. And some offence too
I'm already shitting myself a little bit
Ex Machina
Damnit butler
What about the 90s? 
Why would we hate Kraft? 
Let us be serious. The most prestigious award in the NFL is the MVP
Time to give up a big play on third and long. As is tradition. 
Tom Coughlin without a doubt.
only when we are losing
HOW IS BLAKE BORTLES MAKING THESE THROWS 
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
People acting like this is something out of the ordinary and a sign of something unusual from Brady/Pats clearly didn't watch the 2014 game against the Ravens or basically any time we've played a team that can pressure the QB without blitzing.
Maaan that is a great pass.
You know you sound like a moron when you say that, right?
Fuck off Butler. Getting burned again..
Malcolm Butler washed
Butler can walk idgaf
Fuck
Butler has been trash this season
Wut der fuk
Bortles dropping fucking dimes
Look at us stopping things occasionally! 
Illegal shift means Pats can still challenge IF there was anything there
I remember the daily "Shit on Bortles" threads in the offseason. Is this karma?
"Butler getting torched by a rookie?

No fucking way!?!?!"
I'll say it again, thank god we didn't pay Butler last off-season
Illegal shit
">That was the topic.. not last years SB.

The topic is the Patriots winning.  If you don't like the Patriots winning you should beat them.

>Enjoy the loss today

Is that what you said at half time last Super Bowl?"
As a Revolution fan, Kraft. But realistically, Coughlin.
Hot take. Pressure a QB and he's not as good. More at 11
Butler doesnt seem to understand what a contract year is
Jags
Bortles going Flacco on us
Butler find a different job man. You ass
QQ
That was an amazing catch by Keelan Cole. 
Nah, Scar is a good O-Line coach. 
Of course Butler gets beat
That's a catch. Maybe the best one I have seen all year. 
Jax
That's a catch tho
Butler wishes he took a contract sooner.
Time I suppose... 
Fournette is a beast. Just spun off that sledge hammer.
Damn it I should be prepared for catches like that by now
I never thought I'd say this, but I would much prefer the jags just run the ball the rest of the game
George is getting upset!
That catch just now reminded me of that catch that Julio made. I'm shook.
this jaguar team reminds me a lot of playoffs ravens. i do not like that.
Butlers been burnt toast this season.
I can't believe NE is probably going into the half down 21 to 3.
Did Bortles steal Bradyâ€™s hand?
After that play I'm not sure the pats are meant to win this game
Eh. He's already passed up tons of money
"*pulls off mask
It was Joe Flacco all along."
It's been working.
Yes yes it is.
True, but people also keep saying the game is over when there's still over half the game to play
Hopefully Bortles wakes up during halftime 
The run is getting stuff a bit now. But Bortles is playing Daddy for some reason :/
Butler getting burned again this year. He's really not gonna make big money in FA anymore. 
My own subreddit didnâ€™t see anyone saying otherwise. Credit where credit is due 
">That's the exception not the rule

I really like this saying, and I hate that it is accurate. I want to believe we can do it twice, but I'm not going to lie to myself. "
2016 broncos almost 
If Bortles is making these throws this team is unstoppable.
Wait, I thought the refs were going to hand us the game on a silver platter?
They could have. Would have bee. Stupid but still
The memes would be unreal
Fuck this defense.
21-3 or worse 
Sadly, there are morons who actually think that.
Remember folks, Patriots are a second half team 
I was told Blake Bortles was not a good quarterback.
Name a more iconic duo than patriots defense and giving up long 3rd down conversions
"...We're gonna...."  Partisian hack.
Right here! Hi! 
Eh. It's hard to go back to back. Stinks, but what can you do?
Oh man Pats losing on both sides of the ball. Lets make some adjustments in second half!
"I cannot hate these Jacksonville Jags. I love the pats, but I am happy to see them get some success after all these years. 

I still dont think that Jacksonville is going to win this game but if they do I wont be that upset. "
Idk
If we get the ball back this half, we must score. 
JIMMY G COME BACK
We've got them right where we want them....right?
Lets do it!
Never seen Bortles play this well. What the hell happened 
Damn, Bortles with a monster throw
Dreamworks, no. Pixar, maybe.
She's like a C cup at best in the new games I wouldn't call a C cup well endowed. 
are you watching on mute?
Halftime can't come fast enough. Lot's of adjustments need to be made. 
Can we get an elusive 3rd down stop?
Seriously, our pass defense has been trash, idk why they don't just stick with that
I aint neva eva eva seen Bortles act like that
Who gets ball at half? I missed first 10min
Absolutely. Pats offense needs to get more involved or this is gonna be over fast. 
Yeah pretty disrespectful to the defense. 
Brady is still the GOAT, and Bortles will be backing up Cousins next year lol
My stream is at least a minute behind the game... I keep making outdated comments that make no sense in real time 
FUCKING FIRE PATRICIA AT HALF TIME
Uhh delay of game??
DELAY OF GAME
Third down is not good for us 
Delay of game
Is Bortles ELITE?
pump up his hand, pump it up
Thanks!
Saved by the play clock there.
bad time for a mental mistake
Jags playing the refs hurr durrr 
Lol. Responding to someone elseâ€™s trash talk is lashing out? Flair up if you want to talk shit. 
There were tons of whistles going. Replay it if you want.
Late call but I should add CORRECT call
I sacrificed my first born for that flag
No fucking shit they didn't get the snap off. It was a full second. 
We are still here. Our team is playing after all. How about yours?
Delay of game after a TO is inexcusable. 
Yes
Can we make a fucking stop on 3rd? I swear every drive is two draws up the middle for nothing then a 3rd and long completion every fucking play
Itâ€™s the Bruins goal horn. They started doing it on 3rd downs after the Bruins won the cup in 2011
THANKS REFS
They were blowing the whistle the entire play
The refs didn't cause the delay of game
Shut the fuck up.
What the hell was that
Wow apparently we can just lay on guys now. 
"wow bortles seeing ghosts ive never seen him this shook"
Oh my god
Adam butler has been great
Good stand, let's get some points before half. 
Holy shit we did something!!!
YES DEFENSE! MAKE BLAKE BORTLES LOOK LIKE BLAKE BORTLES! wait...
THERE WE GO 
They didn't, they were blowing the whistle
John Malkovich did this
Fucking sumo slammed our DE to the ground.
Finally they called one.
What a mess lol
It's pretty early to say that...
DelayOfGate?
If we can get 14 to 10 here that will be huge.
Jaguars offence doing better at stopping themselves than the Pats D is so far
Butler tripping when he was about to celebrate reminded me of that Detroit Lion who tore his ACL by celebrating
The clocks are run by neutral parties paid by the NFL. 
But it was a late snap....
TD would be great but all we need is a FG to make it one score game.
I forgot the Jags even had a punter.
[Pats D finally  be like](https://imgur.com/r/highqualitygifs/GfJNU68)
I think Ill just literally tackle this defensive lineman. Just to see if they call it
Obvious flags dumbass.
Whole new ball game if the Pats can get a TD here.
God, they milk every fucking commercial they can.
Foles won't play JAX if the Eagles are slapped by the Vikings 
Jags: Why the hell would you punt before the warning here
2 minute drill time Tom.
Good thing the Jags' coach is protecting his eyes from all of the harmful UV rays
What time is it? It's Gillette Stadium Time!!!
Flag stopped the clock I think 
Good call.
Ooh two minute Brady ðŸ˜
Come at the kings, you best not miss.
Sweet sunglasses 
Pats called a timeout.
our D linemen just got bearhugged to the ground rofl
We needed to score early and not fall behind and weâ€™ve failed to do both. Weâ€™re going to need some turnovers and try to make bortles beat us through the air instead of grinding the clock down. 
Not even like weâ€™re making mistakes. Weâ€™re just getting outplayed
jeff triplette throw one into a players eye once
He sat on him what the fuck are you talking about
"Right, bc a delay of game is so hard to call
"
"Why would you snap it so quick? Pats just got a extra time out.
"
Why didn't they take it down to 2 minutes?
my butthole is very tight, need more alcohol to loosen up
Yeah shouldn't it just be blown dead 
Clear delay of game but sure blame it on the Pats some how
It's called execution.
Who the hell is Tori Kelly?
So. That wasn't a hold? They got the ball off in time? And they got set there?
Big 2 min drill here 
Bradyâ€™s arm is probably locked and loaded to make this 10-16 before the half
Pats called a timeout.
"Pats called timeout

Edit: nvm i have no clue"
Warbortles really has evolved to Bortoise 
It feels good when our defense makes a big play. 
Thank you
You know McDaniels well. 
 Good stop.  Cats have been perfect this game so far,  let's score here.  Let's go!!!
Yeah but that's not soon enough
She's like Tori Amos for a new generation.
Blake â€œgreased up deaf guyâ€ Bortles
They get paid half before and the rest after the game
Just a mistake
8 sacks last week
Blake Michael bortles Vick
Absolutely need to score here. Need momentum.
I get that, and it's awesome, I just hate how a majority wants the Pat's to lose more than they want the Jags to win.  Underdog stories are great, and this game is exciting, so there's that.
Lol come on now, that was a clear flag.
Haha what? These are ironclad penalties...
Idiots punted before the 2 minute warning 
Lol no one denying the delay of game, but because the Pats, they say the fix is in... because the refs called it late? Not sure how that makes sense.
People are really getting pissy about a delay of game that was actually the right fucking call. Jesus christ
They punted too fast 
"Yes, a ref actually hit a player right in the eye a while ago
"
NEED a TD to give some momentum back 
Salt
Way to make use of that free timeless play -.-
Over exuberance has cost many teams everything
Okay, so we can't run it.  Can we stop trying now?
I bet you fucking idiots said the same things about the pats last year. Its not over yet believe it or not. 
Gotta love the instant cut away the second someone looks injured.
Can confirm, asshole is clenched 
Do you typically blow the play dead for delay of game? Not a rules expert. 
Uhh did he just punch Lewis in the head?
Can we claim Jacksonville as a quality loss?
Those penalties were plain as Day, get outta here
Why?
Normally I'd agree but Jags have the ball so... 
Got 'em right where we want 'em
"It was an obvious late snap followed by a super obvious hold. So fortunately nothing marginal or controversial yet.

For the most part this has been a good ""let them play"" game."
/r/nfl: Delay of Game is bullshit, Jags should have an extra 5 seconds to call plays!
>obvious calls
What?
Right, but whether they did or they didn't doesn't change the fact that it was a penalty and should have been enforced
Anyone just see Jack punch Lewis or am I crazy
Debate any of those calls
oh
How? He literally tackled him and laid on top of him lmao
Are the refs evening the game up? Honest question
You gotta be kidding me 
Wrong Kraft. 
These werenâ€™t obvious to you? 
TD here and everythingâ€™s fine. Even a fg is okay...
He is trying to prevent sunburn. Its 45 outside
Huh? He was clearly late.... Are you saying they shouldn't enforce the play clock?
Tori Kelly
If you think that hold wasn't real, I don't know what to tell you
I remember Martin Gramatica celebrating an extra point and getting hurt.
What's a computer?
Jeff Triplette hit Orlando Brown in the eye in 1999. Brown was temporarily blinded and missed three seasons as a result.
 #EliteBortles #RingsErnie
Well I'm not bored
why do they go to commercials with 2 seconds left before the 2 minute warning???
ah yes. because good calls are the worst!!
Youâ€™re not serious right?
I would be so pissed if I saw them filming a commercial and closing lanes on my highway.
What's a computer?
I want a car to come flying off this exit ramp and smash these people sitting in the middle of the fucking highway.

Blatant hold. "The fix is in!"

I'm convinced Apple is just trolling us with that commercial now.
And lost
Dilly dilly!
An outlet for all of life's frustration.
Why hasn't this commercial been pulled from TV yet?
What? Delay of game calls happen all the time.
Need a TD here to have a chance to stay in this game
I'll be saying the same thing to the viking's coach tonight
I hope you fall out of that tree and break your iPad you stupid kid.
Oh boy everyone's favorite commercial is here.
Chevy is shit.  Buy Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, whatever, but not Chevy
Lol "bad call" I bet you say that about literally any call that helps the Pats
What is the point of this thread? Itâ€™s literally just a thousand people saying â€œCheatriotsâ€, â€œRaise your Bortlesâ€, or â€œdonâ€™t forget 28-3 kekâ€. This is a shitshow.
You do realize that sometimes they have trouble getting the flag off their belt, right? Or that the graphic doesn't always call it when the ref does? 
Up vote if you hate Scout
Are people really going to act like that wasnâ€™t an actual hold? The refs are bailing the Pats out on a blatant hold that wasnâ€™t even accepted?
the fucks a computer
Pats defense is showing signs of life, now we just need a score and I'll feel much better 
It really is sad seeing how people can say a O-lineman literally laying on top of a D-lineman isn't a penalty. 
People once again complaining about obvious calls. These game threads are a joke.
All I know is that we need to have the Jacksonville Jag's women to be commenting on every game. She can come in and Steal the show any day of the week. 
After watching that commercial I have a strange impulsion to buy a Chevy 
What's a Com-POO-ter?
Idk, their D has been stingy thus far. It's gonna be tough.
He's not a wizard... He's Jaffa...  stupid king.
Probably similar to the percentage who like this Apple ad
Once again McDaniels decides that a two minute drill includes a run up the middle
Flair up brosef.
I can't believe we put up with these commercials all the time.
The refs did nothing wrong. If you say they did you're just being ignorant
oh hi
Pats only getting 2.3 ypg god damn.
Yeah I thought the same
I don't know what's worse, Young Sheldon commercials or Apple commercials.
7 Commercials in this break so far.
"Man literally tackles a rusher:

31 other teams: WTF REFS ARE FIXING THIS SHIT

Yall should look down at all the ""the fix is in"" comments lawl. "
Yeah what of we got a pick 6. It should be blown dead right away. Refs overall these playoffs have really sucked.  Messing up easy decisions.
The jags are hardly a shit team.

No she's not an actor she's an accountant - so what she's being paid to be here saying good things about the car."
Did Chevy close down a whole lane of traffic for that commercial? 
Tom Brady doesn't have a losing record against a team in the NFL. 
commercial, run play, commercial.  i'm liking the pats offensive strategy.
Do you love sitting in gum, too?
Look at them try to convince us the Microsoft surface is as good as the iPad.
It would be the new 'Elite Dragon's meme all over again
Oh God no
Pit of Misery, Dilly Dilly!
LOL one delay of game penalty and now the game is rigged..... go figure
Really poor half from us, but the Jags have been so impressive. Fournette has been on it
Ok McDaniels. This up the gut shit with Lewis needs to stop. It hasn't worked yet. You have the GOAT back there. Let him do GOAT things. Get back in empty looks like the first drive and let him dink and dunk. 
Bunch of people already bitching about "home cooking" and checks being cleared. 
Yâ€™all get WAY too upset over a commercial.
Why are they sitting at a table on the highway? Hopefully it's Chevy's entire marketing team and someone runs them over!
i mean, you already have him.

Chevys are awful. Buy a ford, dodge, or Toyota truck instead.

Shad Kahn is a cool motherfucker
They said 30 seconds and it's been 2 minutes of ads, still going....
Dilly dilly has gone to some dark territory with the mad king turning his court into bud light
With young Sheldon coming up not too long after 
I'll root for you guys if you win, especially if you're against the Eggles.
He's not wrong lol
Id shoot Toby twice
We need a touchdown before the half that's non-negotiable..
Damn, jags hit hard
Cooks the only one whoâ€™s able to get open
Tori Kelly's voice is great
He's an alcoholic.
Shoot the arrow kid 
Disappointing half but I feel like it's been more the Jags making the Pats play poorly.
FUCK TONY ROMO
Why did Romo sound like he wasn't sure if Cooks was in bounds. It could not be more obvious...
Coooooks...unnnnhhgggggg, in
Tommy Time 
Tony, bud, cooks was in by a mile. 
Cooks^Got ^^^^In?
Jaguars
Jags 
Tom Brady and the 2 minute warning. Name a better couple. I'll wait. 
Tony Romo has money on the Jags. Has to be with the amount of slant towards them right now. 
I'm Ron Burgundy?
Tip: Try throwing the ball at the fucking giant with the 87 shirt. He might be good
Incoming ref hate.
*Sportsball
I'm going to do this too
lol how? By forcing Jax to hold 
Bortles should not be playing this well. I'd say there's a 80% chance that the Jaguars have the Patriots defensive game plan. 
Which of those flags was remotely iffy?
Was that in there too? I just mean those ones consecutively.
Khan's mustache is the best mustache 
His left foot was out. 
Well he was been packing the rest of the AFC North the past 17 years.
Brady looks sharp now, 7 inc
AHHHHHAAAHAHAHAHAHHHHHH COMPUTEEERRRRSSSS!!!!
Cooks is literally our best deep threat. Gronk is getting sandwiched in coverage.
Because he needs the money for Scotch
Targetting
Cmon, put some points on the board.
Head to head on a defenseless receiver. Easy call
Gronk is concussed....
Pass interference 100%
Gronk getting fucked up
Gronk is super concussed now...
If that's not helmet to helmet I'm a toaster
Wow. Dirty fucking hit. Fuck fuck. 
Dirty hit 
Gronk is dead. That man is deceased.
Dirty Jags
Gronk doesnâ€™t know where he is. 
Give me another for taunting. What the fuck was he doing with his towel after?!
FUCKKK GRONK NOOO
Ohh you got to be kidding me...
Not really.
Oh shit... not Gronk.
Dirty ass team
Clear as day called every game. 
Fuck your dirty shot
lighthouses
what a fucking bitch
LOL "cooks... got... in?"
how do defenders even question why they get called for those penalties?
Fuck you guy
Bullshit call my ass that is a clear helmet to helmet
Dirty fucking bitch
If Cam wasn't taken out Gronk shouldn't come out /s
dude, fuck me. Gronk is concussed.
He literally headhunted 
bountygate
Guck. Gronk's concussed? 
Gronk u ok man? :(
Oh Jags defense head hunting? I'm shocked
Helmet to helmet fuuuuck that 
Damn, that was dirty as fuck
FUCK
YEA BUT WERE THE BAD GUYS
So that's how JAX wants to win. 
Jaguar celebrating his dirty hit. Fucking thug team. 
Wow the fucking NFL finally learns how to call a fucking penalty on the defense when it involves Gronk?
Lol, coming from a jags fan during this game.
Seriously?
Keep celebrating a dumb hit to the head that ~~adds 15 yards to the spot~~ gives up 15 yards.
But that's how the Winter Solider was created.
Scumbags.
Barry church is a fucking pussy
That should be an ejection 
Flair up pussy
Dirty ass jags
Ah no, Gronk.
dirty ass hit
Lol. Helmet to helmet hit sweetheart 
You're a dirty piece of shit Barry Church. 
Cheap shot. I guess thatâ€™s the Jags MO. 
Dirty fucking team 
Dirtiest of dirtiy plays.
That was so dirty
You're a fucking idiot dude. That's a penalty one million times out of a million.
Fuck Barry
To anyone hoping Gronk is hurt: how fucking low are yâ€™all?
happy that he hit gronk in helmet. wow.
Fuck you that's as blatant as you can get
Jesus christ
I mean, he could have not led with his head, I suppose
So why aren't we ejecting him?
Yo jags, don't celebrate that shit
You'd surprised, there's a few round here
Are you fucking serious?
well it's a good thing that the concussion protocol is a joke
That's a cuncussion.
errybody mad
Man, between 74 and that Jags are trying to take guys out.
Dirty hit
lol but the Patriots are the dirty team right 
Yeah. Fuck player safety. You asswipe. 
Stay classy Jags. 
I'll take the blatant DPI instead.
Church should be out of the game
"Fuck him, celebrating his headhunting.

"
wtf I hate the Jags now
Dirty fucking play.
Blatant helmet to helmet hits like that should be an automatic ejection. 
Wow jags are pieces of shit 
That was intended. Gronk being out is what will leave us destroyed.
he was tackled and they don't throw a flag.
Ah yes why cover Gronk when you can hospitalize him.
Uh no, Gronk...
What a fucking punk
What the fuck man
"You cant do that, and they need to update it so if the player flagged for it cant play if the player he knocked out is out.

That was fucking headhunting bullshit"
Clear helmet to helmet patriot haters got their blinders on full right now 
That's how he normally looks.
Like... when he is supposed to?
You can make big hits, just not to the head. 
YOU DIRTY FUCKS
Concussion protocol with Gronk might be hard because I'm not sure he knows how to spell his name anyways.
Fuck you church.
Fuck church 
there's there's nothing to think on. it's not that best division, but it's not the worse
Thanks refs. Where you been at all half fam?!
should be 2 defensive penalties. CB grabbed him by the feet.
I swear to god, the patriots hate is real. That was a helmet to helmet hit
Celebrate your dirty hit church?
Fuck Barry Church making an illegal hit, taunting after, and then gloating. This defense can get fucked. 
Back to back easy calls. 
He just pushed him out of bounds 
This defense are like suicide bombers. Going 110 mph willing to take themselves out
Yay baby!!!
Ridiculous.. you can concussed the best player on the field for 15 yards
That was a clear helmet to helmet hit on a defensless reciever
What a piece of shit hit
well here come the barrage of flags for the jags
Did a good play by hunting his head?
Can't shove him out of bounds
Its crazy, how are people defending that hit? 
Wow... everyone celebrating a hit to the head...
GOTTEM
Gronk's head, Fournette's knee. Blood for Blood.
WTF
The NFL needs a targeting rule. If you can take out the other teams best player and not get ejected, why wouldn't you? 
That hit was fucking brutal
Jags are lacking discipline
Donâ€™t go high for the hit?
The old Joe Flacco method
INB4 refball
Lmao they are actually getting called for the bullshit theyâ€™ve been pulling all game
Finaly.
Jesus jacksonville youre mugging us out there
Been a few of those I thought deserved flags. Finally.
Fuck you.
Jags being undisiplined is gonna end up killing them in this game
Can't wait to see all the refs helping the Patriots comments.  Let the hate flow through you
You must have failed anatomy
JAX are a bunch of cowards. 
Gronk no
Church was celebrating that he took Gronk out of the game
Barry knew what he was doing that should've been an ejection 
Bouye you're a bum
Fuck you
Sooooo was that not a targeting hit?
inB4 paid refs shit starts
please tell me you are joking..
Lol pushing the receiver out of bounds while the ball is in the air is  perfectly fine!! 
Terrible attitude to have about the health of players and the game
Gronk off is massive
Here comes the "tHe ReFs ArE HeLpInG ThE pAts"
Oh shit Gronk is going out
Here we go
You cant even blame the refs on these...all egregious penalties 
Not when you're shoved out of bounds so that you can't cut in
Concussions are funny!
Ugly hit
Fuck off
Yes and his foot was out of bounds. 
That was clearly helmet to helmet, what are you talking about?
That was a dirty fucking hit on Gronk.
You think it wasn't a PI?
Obvious helmet to helmet and obvious PI? Gtfo bitch
Yeah idk why they did that. I guess itâ€™s loud
Maybe the jaguars shouldnâ€™t commit penalties
"What hit are you talking about? He led with his helmet on Gronk
"
Intentionally to make gronl sit ðŸ‘€
inb4 ppl say the refs made them go helmet to helmet on Gronk
Iâ€™ve said it all season, I hate these smack talking shit head cheap shot Jaguars. Enjoy losing to a team without their best receiver, Fuckers. 
Yeah his reaction afterwards was a dick move
...it's clearly a penalty 
causal fans will about the back to back penalties, but that's two obvious penalties 
Take your upvote, you fuck.
Man, to be a safety and get all these cheap free shots 
Jesus fuck, that's a dirty hit
Like 15 yards straight of interference. Can't whine about that. But you will. 
"How fn dirty are the Jags?
"
You can't push the wr out of bounds
Are you kidding? That should be a suspension
wow... dirty hit
Oh I get it. Jax D dirty af. Game plan? Concuss Gronk with a dirty helmet to helmet
"GRONK IS ALWAYS WOBBLY

HE'S FINE

I SWEAR"
Lmao as a falcons fan 1. You shouldn't be talking shit. 2. You should know how good they are 
C L A S S Y 
THANK YOU REFS
"So an illegal headshot then shoving a wr out of bounds arenâ€™t penalties? 

Sure bud"
What?...
Are you saying those were not penalties?
"15 yards to take out their best ~~player~~ target, why wouldn't you?

Edited for the pedants"
Let's get the /r/nfl blaming the refs going now 
Bouye literally pushing Cooks OOB.
If Gronk goes in to the concussion protocol he'll never make it out. On his best day, Gronk couldn't count all those fingers the doctor holds up...
He looked right at it
Fuckin dirty hit on Gronk. 
 please come back GRONK.  
they're is no penalty that isn't worth taking Gronk out of the game
Fucking headhunt
Flag for manhandling him
...that was crown of the helmet to the face. Am I insane?
What a dirty fucking hit
I know somebody named Collin Cullen
Don't fucking aim for the dudes helmet?
Jags are playing like dumb fucking animals.
Jags leading, still getting desperate and hitting gronk in the head AND kicking him? da fuq
Worth it. 
WHERE WAS THIS PLAY CALLING ALL HALF?
Impossible without gronk
[When the Patriots get a flag in their favor and the rigged comments start coming out.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cj9Q6D1UYAAaFGe.jpg)
so that wasn't PI and gronk wasn't speared in the head?
Patriots will help themselves. Enjoy the show.
Flag for blatant PI.
You're scum
Okay so I guess it is okay to take a run at Fournette's head and knock him out of the game right?
Letâ€™s fucking go 
Let the tears flow
What happened to the tent?
Flag for molesting him
are you fucking serious
Oh shit they left bortles too much time
TOUCHDOWN!!!!!!!
Fuck that. Stupid dirty fuckinnt jags
Intent doesn't matter when you hit a receiver helmet to helmet.
nah it was dirty
If he hit shoulder to helmet itâ€™s still a penalty.
Whole new ball game. Let's fucking go
Boom!
lol everyone liking dirty hits against pats players smh 
Is that Bernard Pollard?
Back in it baby!!!
He smacked White wtf
get fucked jags
White for the TD yeeaaahhhh
lol only way they can get rid of gronk
Brady is still in dude.
It wasn't catchable because of the PI lol.
Or, you know, jags could just not commit blatant penalty
that's normal for him though 
Youâ€™re god damn right!
Are you really saying those were not penalties?
NOT GRONK
"""what do you mean you're not allowed to shove a receiver out of bounds while the pass is in the air? Patriots biased fucking refs smh""

-/r/NFL"
I don't care what team you play on, I don't want to see you get hurt.
Patented Brady 2-Minute Drill ^TM
Myles Jack is a punk.
Wtf that's a personal foul after the TD
Go for 2
Wtf is going on?
"*Jaguars commit two obvious penalties*
r/nfl - â€œoh look, the refs are helping the pats win this game againâ€"
it was helmet to helmet lmao of course it was dirty
Youâ€™re right. Clearly Bouye was justified in pushing Cooks out of bounds.
If Gronk is concussed, Church should be ejected. Literally fucking launched at his head. If you take someone out in a dirty play, you should be too.
Ref is like, CALM DOWN IM TINY YOU LINEMAN.
Losing Gronk is going to be huge.
Gronk just needs to pop a tide pod and he'll be straight
If you don't want to get called for PI, get your head around. It's that simple.
Jags are being punks
classy Jags player tossing him after he scored..
I'm playoff James White, and I have direct TV.
Waaa waaa waaa 
No the refs aren't biased, thats what happens when you have a corner like Bouye who fouls every other play
Solid strategy by the jags, give up 15 yards but take Gronk out of the game
lol Jax is so fucking dirty. Mentally soft bs on every play
More shit from JAX after the play. Dirty fucking D they got there. 
"About FUCKING TIME

enjoy winning one quarter, because that's all Brady will allow. "
They got this shit back up in literally a minute LMAO
Likely lost Gronk for the game on a dirty as shit play, so.... 
i think the ref calls are questionable sometimes for sure, but the jags are definitely doing dumb/immature shit right now. 
He shoved him out of bounds, that's the easiest PI call ever.
Dat ref - "I know I know"
Celebrating a guy getting hurt. No words really
Yeah hit him after the score good job.
Are the Jags always this dirty?
BOSTON STRONG BOYS 
FINALLY...i mean...whats a computer?
"not dirty how about the slap to the head after the TD?
"
"Jags have worked themselves into a frenzy. They need to calm down if they are going to keep control. 

They are going 100mph and not being careful. You can't beat the Pats making mistakes."
Todays half time fireworks show provided by the yellow flags of the Jaguars
Jags being undisciplined
There's literally about a 6' window between gronks head and his knees.
That was obviously pass interference.
How?  Both were as blatant as you can get.
Should be another flag on Jax right there in the end zone. Garbage people 
Dude likely has a concussion and people are saying refs had a bad call. Scrubs 
Oh fuck off. The flags are coming out because the other team is breaking the rules
Actually pushing him out of bounds. How are people saying that isn't pi.
Jeez I get people hate the Pats but how do you argue the helmet to helmet on Gronk?
Obvious penalties lol
Can't shove someone out of bounds
Typical patriots fashion , give the haters a glimps of hope, then Crush thier souls second half 
"Thatâ€™s not a fucking penalty?

God the Jags are dirty as shit"
Jags defense shot themselves in the foot
So much salt, we could use you in New England when it snows some more. 
Man, the Jags are the dirtiest team in the NFL I swear to God.
late ass tackle by 44 too
Oh fuck off. Those were both clear penalties. Blame your defense for playing like shitheads.
Is this your first year watching football?
Lol jags gonna wrack up penalty after penalty and people be like "Pats pay the refs"
Should be anither flag on the unnecessary roughness
Jags dumb penalties*
You guys are winning, and you're still preemptively planning to blame a loss on penalty calling.
"I'm going to preempt the the rest of the thread before the  half...

RRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEE!!Â¡!!!!!!Â¡!!!!!!"
Lmao fuck this thread celebrating a dirty hit but questioning an easy call 
The flags are just coming out now. First quarter was really good.
That;s because the defender pushed him out of bounds and kept him out of bounds.
Are you seriously saying that wasn't a helmet to helmet and OPI? Church put Gronk in concussion protocol and Bouye shoved Cooks out of bounds. Get your eyes checked boi.
Dumbass defense drive by the Jags.
Lol are you guys really trying to say those weren't correct calls?
And he hit him square in the side of the face, knocking him out of the game. Fuck that hit, doesn't matter what he was trying to do. Plus he celebrated after it.
He pushed him out of bounds.   What are you smoking?
Jags have been playing great, but if they can't keep themselves in check, this is gonna turn around
Pretending that wasn't PI is ridiculous. Relax Jags, you're still probably gonna win with Gronk out.
That's about as blatant as can be.
Yeah head to head hits should totally be legal
LIFE! LET'S GOOOOOO
It was a horseshit call. What else was he supposed to do? 
Oh boy, game thread is getting cancerous 
Huge.
"Don't over-react. 

It was a dumb and dangerous play but the Jags have been fun to watch all year. Don't be whiny because we're losing."
"All of you â€œbig hit,â€ shitheads. 

CTE and long term player health are whatâ€™s going to kill this game. When parents stop letting kids play because itâ€™s too dangerous, then there wonâ€™t be **any** more hits. "
Bouye played that coverage like it was a punt 
it isn't the jags fault for the helmet to helmet then pushing the receiver out of bounds pretty much?
"Gronk gave that maybe-concussion to himself!"
Lol wait which call was wrong?
Saw a bunch of comments cheering Gronk getting hurt. Itâ€™s cancerous now. 
the jags are classless dirty fucks fuck em
The Empire Strikes Back 
After a clear helmet to helmet hit followed by a clear push out of bounds with the ball in the air. 
I agree
Lol @ all of the dumbasses saying those were not justified penalties. 
Hahahahaha yeah that wasnâ€™t interference at all lmao
fuck these dirty ass jags
Hope the pats put those cocky dbacks in their place 
LOL
#EJECTCHURCH
If Blake bortles walked into the field and shot Brady in the face you guys would be comaining about the flag.
Lol at all of the other 31 teams fans bitching. You know you'd be whining for a flag if that was the other way. Obvious helmet to helmet.
by whom? big defensive mistakes? 
One of the best times to get that, bit of doubt in their heads going into half time.
"Blantant helmet to helmet, blantant PI... HURR DIRR DA REFS

"
Left too much time on the clock  for Bortles to work his magic  :0 
I love agressive defenses but it's definitely a high risk high reward style.
Haha you guys are fucking insufferable 
well deserved penalties
Damn is Gronk gonna be back
They poked the bear
I honestly, truly have no idea how so many people ITT have so little comprehension of football that they don't know how clear those flags were. Like holy shit, does anyone know the rules?
Naturally. 
"you donâ€™t think those were deserved?

edit-honest question"
You mean from the hit to the head and blatant Pi?
"Romo: ""That's a definite penalty.""

r/NFL: ""REFBALL REEEEE"""
Boom!!!!
Pats
After that dirty hit, screw it. Throw a flag against the Jags every. Single. Down. 
Tackle him legally. 
"Umm, rather than people bitching about refs, why aren't they asking why Jags are making so many unforced errors while ahead?

None of these flags have been marginal."
"Did Romo say that ""they're gonna say hes okay"" like he knows players have been cleared despite not being okay

Edit: ask for clarification, get 10 of the exact same reply and a couple downvotes. Classic

Go Pats! Never in doubt!"
Name me one penalty that wasnt a penalty?
Ayyy thank mr steelers fan
This is when the haters surface.
Is that why the helmet hit helmet?
By not ramming his face directly into Gronk's?
Or maybe they committed two penalties?
Which call was questionable? 
Jacksonville is chippy as fuck
Romo needs to STFU with his play predictions.  He's wrong more than half the time.
Lmao
Are you talking about targeting like in college? There isnâ€™t a rule in nfl
Or Jacksonville will commit dumbass penalties 
Gift from the Jags making stupid plays
I get the hate for NE< but you got be blind if you think that's not a PI. Or watching football for the 1st time
Or just don't create penalties
You look rough, bro
... he was pushed out, that's the interference lol
And he got suspended for it. What Gronk did was wrong. 
He pulled up and lead with the crown of his helmet.  That's not a misfire that's bad tackling form you learn not to do in fucking peewee
ðŸ™„
Tilted 
Lol. Troll elsewhere
Yea that wasnâ€™t a hit to the head or PI ðŸ™„
Fuck you Barry Church
James White with his usual playoff antics. 
> ~~Refs~~ Jag's defense keeping it close. 
Shook about Gronk... there's no way he's coming back. But let's GO. Don't care how we got those points, needed them bad.
This thread is ridiculous. That was one of the clearest helmet to helmet hits you can have. 
"Dude it refball! 
"
Both of those penalties were correct. 
Well, you guys have gotten away with a few, they can only help you so much
Why not
he literally shoved him out of bounds while the ball was in the air how is that not a PI
At least Gronk didn't celebrate like he was some big tough guy after his dirty hit. Big difference there. 
"What are you smoking? He was literally pushed out of bounds. 

Holy fuck, I get you hate the Patriots, but that's just sad"
Yeah since when is it illegal to slam your helmet into a defenseless receivers helmet and also to shove a receiver out of bounds while he's trying to catch a ball? Fucking bs
in a playoff game?   nah.
You know it!
really man?  Like I want a good game and I know i'm a pats fan.  But really?  That church hit on gronk wasn't legit?  That hold on all the way down the sidelines wasn't legit?  C'mon here.  
You guys actually think pushing a guy out of bounds is legal?
helmet to helmet was clear as day. the DPI can be questioned tho
what would you call that...
Fuck yeah!
Glad to see this thread devolve into the same bullshit it did last week.
Another dirty tackle from a jag. Surprise
I know right the play where they hit Gronk in helmet how can u penalize that right shut the fuck upsurge whiny bullshit. Or how about delay of game how can the refs let them run the clock to 0 and call a penalty on it.
This thread is a meltdown lmao
It's embarrassing 
"How is that not roughness on 44? Already in, fucking slams him down.

EDIT: I was wrong, replay was normal"
Pats fans who actually defended that are dumb. Give context maybe, but actually say it was ok? Fuck them.
Lmao why the fuck are the jags defenders tryin to act so hard sit the fuck down
"*pushes the receiver out of bounds*


r/NFL ""TURRIBLE CALL"""
Lmao
all clear penalties. 
Bringing some Florida stank into Gillette 
None of us defended that. I remember every pats fan saying how stupid it was for him to do that when it happened 
He didn't have time to brace, not sure what you were watching.
Should implement the targeting rule from college. That hit on Gronk deserves an ejection 
How are people disagreeing with these penalties? Honestly. Stop blaming the refs and blame the players who are throwing helmet-to-helmet tackles.
But the refs are fixing the game!   /s
Lol how? Neither penalties were questionable
LOL, I wonder why Ref 112 was laughing
what a dirty team 
Miles Jack playing chippy bordering dirty right now. The hit on Burkhead was hard but clean. Then he starts shit in the Endzone.
Uhhhh nah
Lets not disrupt the circle jerk.
That tackle in the end zone too
How the fuck were those questionable?
Oh, here come the child fans of the game. They were happy with the no call dpi on cooks earlier and now are mad about helmet to helmet 
You'd think Gronk volunteered to have his head smashed
Jags are dirty players
How is it not a penalty to whip someone to the ground after the play is long over
The salt levels in this thread are off the charts
I agree. Either it was on both or its uncatchable
Lmao at the ppl who didn't think that was a DPI.
What calls were questionable?
Brady and the two minute drill. name a better duo
Clear helmet to helmet, evidence is the fucking concussion he gave our best receiver, and then getting driven out of bounds on a pass, giving the also very clear DPI. WTF are you talking about?
Bouye pushes Cooks literally out of bounds on the route, which is TEXTBOOK DPI, and you idiots are still complaining that refs are helping the Pats.
Right? It should be totally legal to hit helmet to helmet and push the wr out of bounds
#GRONK HIT HIMSELF IN THE HEAD OBVIOUSLY
Yeah, cheap shots
Yeah, the refs were totally holding Cooks his entire route.
Jags are winning and they can't keep from falling apart / playing filthy for one half of football.
Okay that's definitely a unsportsmanlike penalty after the td. Jags d is playing douchy as fuck.
Those calls were obvious AF folks
Which call was iffy?
I didn't have anything against the Jags. Until now.  Fuck the dirty ass jags.
"*Two blatant Jacksonville penalties*

/r/nfl: FIXED"
Well, we don't all hate them. Thanks for saying that though!
"Are you arguing that wasn't a helmet to helmet hit, and it wasn't OPI (pushing the receiver out of bounds)?

"
 Not lead with your helmet.   Which is what he did. 
He punched him after too, should be tossed
I know you guys hate the Pats but those were two penalties. Not even debatable. 
All jax has to do is stop playing dirty. Just tackled a guy in the endzone
You can slam an RB into the ground four yards into the endzone and then slap his facemask after he gets up? Jags starting to get dirty in this game.
Um both of those calls were correct
He didn't.
Church is a fucking scumbag...you have to aim so high to hit Gronk in his head. Fucking dirtbag
Happy about a potential concussion? You are the scum if the Earth
Helmet to helmet contact, right call. clear Dpi, right call... 
How the fuck is everyone so mad and the Pats are still losing? Yâ€™all really have to find a balance in your life 
Gronkâ€™s 6â€™7 itâ€™s pretty obvious thatâ€™s intentional 
Jags play one of the most undisciplined drives on D ive ever seen and everyone says the refs handed the pats a td. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘Œ
Because they arent
Cooks pass not remotely uncatchable. At full sprint, he covers thirty yards while the ball is in the air.
Which one of those penalties did you think was unfair? 
Pats score a TD.. people blaming refs. Here we go boys!
Could've had a shot if he wasn't pushed out of bounds
How the fuck do you figure? He wrestled Cooks out of bounds lol.
ITT: Other fans baling "refs" for the right calls.....
Oh fuck you. Guy just targeted gronk and clear push out of bounds. Learn the fucking rules. 
15 yards in front of him because he was pushing him out of bounds for 20 yards, sure
There it is. Was waiting for the blaming the refs to start 
Because they were good calls?
So those were unfair calls? 
Don't lead with your helmet and head down?
"It looked like helmet to helmet contact on my TV, pretty close though could have gone either way

k..."
Which one, leading with the crown of the helmet or the force out? Both are EASY calls.
Prediction - Gronk is concussed but will be back in the 2nd half anyway. He should sit the rest of this game. :(
Youâ€™re pathetic, 2 obvious penalties and it is suddenly a fix. 
how did gronk have time lol its up to the defender to avoid the head to head thats simple
Lol he wrapped him up. Thatâ€™s the most blatant dpi call you can get bro
The PI call was PI dummies.
"Just ask how many fingers he has.

Doctor: 'how many am I holding up'

Gronk: 69

Doctor: he's fine"
The guy clearing players isn't affiliated with the teams. It's an NFL doctor.
Yeah. I hate it when they throw flags every time there's an obvious penalty.
Obvious penalties that had they been on the Jags nobody would have a problem with them ðŸµðŸ¸
I hope gronk is ok
28-3
That was the most black and white call of helmet to helmet I've ever seen. It could be on the film the league sends to players.
defense.exe application failed to initialize
Yes because one bad thing means that people can do whatever they want to Gronk
Itâ€™s stupid. 
Which one wasnâ€™t a penalty? There was a clear helmet to helmet hit and the defender shoved him out of bounds without even attempting to look for the ball. Those are penalties.
Mmmmmmmmmm so yummy 
Pretty sure there wasn't one on the TD or the PAT or the Cooks catch.
Refs call blatantly obvious penalties, clearly the gameâ€™s rigged 
Both of those were pretty clearly penalties.
Pretty sure that would be great for ratings.
i agree that some calls have been questionable, but these last two definitely weren't. jags are just being dumb/immature. 
not catchable because he shoved him out 10 yards before
~30-35 I think
They only know that they hate the Patriots.
People hate the Pats so much that delay of game, helmet to helmet hits and obvious PI means the game is rigged? Refs have called a good half.
If the jags didn't break the rules there wouldn't be penalties.
Wouldnâ€™t that make it worse? Have to go higher for the head?
So... if that isn't an ejection for church (obvious head shot + taunt), why not put a scrub in there and head shot fournette? While he's getting tackled just lop his head off... all is fair right? Seriously... refs are not in control of this game... jax very chippy after every play and getting worse.
Legitimate calls. /r/nfl is crying as is usual.
Nailed it
They could have called DPI on the brink hit too. The TB was leg tackling him when the ball got tgere.
lol I said the same thing 
Just tell them you dont wanna buy shit if you dont wanna buy shit.
Lol when he was getting hit in the helmet?
I didn't catch the start of the game, who gets the ball after halftime?
Lmao
Jesus Jags have no discipline 
They are so fucking dirty. I can't wait to see them lose
It's always been that way since they changed the rules in 04
You canâ€™t headbut a receiver in the face mask, I canâ€™t believe you are actually arguing this.
So many shitters in this thread muh refs for clear penalties. Fuck off
"Look at how the Jags players are  behaving even after the play is over. You tell me that is a well controled and well coached team.

Take off your fucking blinders. "
I just want to say that Amendola was in a wing back position and did a great job blocking out on a corner. That guy is so clutch. 
This thread is about to go downhill real fast
It was literally a textbook helmet to helmet hit. Dirty as fuck 
I am fucking crying right now. Is this the end of the dynasty?? I am fucking depressed 
Quick guys say something about the refs for upvotes
Wtf? Is this a rational person on r/NFL?
not quite to Titans-Pats level of cancer....yet
"Tony Romo: ""Definite penalty, 100% easy call""

/r/nfl commenters: ""TD by the refs, game rigged"""
It was helmet to helmet.... You can't do that.
White was untouched on that goal line carry but ok
It'll always be that way unless the NFL incorporates a rule like targeting in college. That rule isn't perfect obviously, but it gives you a stronger disincentive to hit a guy like that. 15 yards is nothing, an ejection actually makes a difference
Fuck is wrong with you, helmet to helmet is a weak call? 
"questionable? that wasnt a helmet to helmet on gronk?

you must be fucking blind

everyone knows the tide just turned in this game and people blame the refs"
That's how penalties work. The refs have to re-spot the ball.
I mean, helmet hit. That's questionable?
Are you fucking serious? Lol. Did you not see Gronk get hit helmet to helmet and Cooks shoved out of bounds? 
I may be wrong but I believe illegal contact when the ball is in the air is considered pass interference 
A clear PI and Clear unnecessary roughness?
Dumbasses are out full force in this thread. 
What Gronk did wasn't even a hit
Bitch some more 
They were both obvious penalties....
Dude, Bouye literally pushed Cooks out of bounds on the route before the ball got there. How the fuck is that ticky-tacky? It would be called in any fucking game.
I feel bad for you.
"I refute.
What do I get for winning this dare?"
The rule doesnâ€™t say it has to be intentionall. Itâ€™s more so defenders will wrap up and stay lower.
Because he hit him in the head with his head?
Incoming refs are helping pats comments
Thanks for the good vibes mate! 
"Itâ€™s so hilarious how people are really saying those were both bs calls just because they hate the pats.

Call refball all you want but it just shows you donâ€™t understand basic football rules."
He was trying to come back inside to the ball and the db pushed him out of bounds. What are you talking about?
No it wasn't. He was holding him for most of the route when he didn't need to. 
Guess youâ€™re one of those rare blind NFL fans.
THANK YOU 
Totally not blatant penalties huh? Shut up your saltiness is showing
/r/nfl: "Concussions and CTE are okay as long as it happens to the Patriots"
Lol, now the faded flairs are bitching about the refs, when they made the right calls. Typical Pats game
T H A N K S R E F S
Pats hate is dumb. Gronk call was textbook. Cooks PI is called 80% of the time this year. 
That h2h on Gronk made me actually livid
Fuck Dirty Players 
Jags knock out the Patriots biggest weapon and you guys are upset at the refs. Classic r/nfl
I have seen a lot of Patriots DBs that didn't turn their head around
Missed DPI on the Brink hit make up call. 
No, it's Cooks' fault for getting pushed out of bounds.  Fucking refs.  Gronk obviously headbutting Church.
He was trying to get his arm free, the only place he had to was over his head.
Go fuck off you prick. The jags clearly broke the rules
You can refute that with the Ref.
It's DPI because you can't block the route of the receiver before the ball is even in play.
Here comes the r/nfl "any penalty that helps the pats means the game is rigged" brigade
Didn't take long for me to hate this Jags team, the fans make it easier too, but man they are a bunch of undisciplined, whiny brats, lol.
Fuck Barry Church 
Yeah, maybe not catchable since he was being held the entire route?
I still don't know why he pushed Cooks out of bounds. You could see the left arm extend, I'm sure that's what drew the flag. Just a bad decision since he was all over him.
Riding the guy out of bounds is ticky tack?
maybe he thinks he's gonna get the ball back before the half lol
I thought the same at first, but it didn't look quite as bad on replay. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, cuz it wasn't a dirty hit at all, right? 
Oh frick off Ricky. Dirty hit and a blatant PI.
hiiiiii
Thank you Eagle bro 
Gronk gets held on every play lol. I'd rather they just let him and the defenders work it out.
Here come the crybabies. Wahh the refs. Wahhhh..
I love how anytime the patriots have something go their way everyone here says itâ€™s the refs even when itâ€™s obvious penalties 
Questionable if you don't know the rules.
Is this sub really more upset about a DPI call than by Church giving Gronk brain damage?
Shoved out of bounds
Yeah after he was held up and shoved 2 yards out of bounds he shoved back, totally matching penalties
Youâ€™re delirious 
Oh, that helmet-to-helmet wasn't a penalty?
Cause bouye complete cut him off lol. 
Flair up bitch
Lol idiot
You think he hit Gronk in the head by accident?
"Dude head checks Gronk and Our receiver gets pushed out of bounds...

Everyone in this thread - oh the refs are giving them the game again.

Have some fucking respect for the rules. That's two obvious calls, that if the Pat's did some shit like that we'd all be asking ourselves what the fuck we're doing.

This is basic football boys, get your shit together. Don't start doing stupid things and then yell all hail Mary about the refs."
Are you guys really arguing the legality of pushing receivers out of bounds just because he plays for the patriots. Lol, grow up. That was a completely correct PI call.
Oh no, the referees are giving penalties to players breaking the rules...
They get ball to start the half. I say play it safe, they're in control rn.
I'll take "Sentances I never thought I'd read for $1000"
/r/evilleagueofevil sticking up for each other like they should
The dude had Cooks wrapped up out of bounds. At the very least it's holding.
or maybe the hit to the head when he got up also... Jags are dirty.. won't end well for them...
He pushed cooks out of bounds. If he just kept controlling the space and doesn't actually push, it's not a problem
Bruh, they were penalties
Maybe if the Jags didn't make those penalties, then we wouldn't have scored. We didn't pay off the refs you short-sighted imbeciles. 
thank you. 
LOL Jags, a lot of game left.
This isnt 1998, it doesn't matter if he leads with his shoulder. It's a headshot on a defenseless reciever.
Not a single call was a soft call there
Gifting? Blatant helmet to helmet, blatant PI. 
Questionable penalties. They were textbook.
Lemme know when the refs call a ghost penalty.  Both calls were textbook.
Christ are you trying to kill me?
what do you call them then? Non penalties for running a receiver out of bounds and a helmet to helmet hit on a defenseless receiver 
They took out our best mismatch on a dirty play but its the pats that the refs helped
Classless by Church celebrating a concussion.
Right? That was about as obvious as it gets
Waaah! 
Feel like we're playing the Bengals today. 
Hahaha your team couldn't even win a wild card game
Grumble grumble grumble paying off the refs grumble grumble!
Lets go boys.
Helmet to helmet is 101. The DPI was literally shoving him out of bounds. Get over yourself.
People really tryna say the gronk hit wasnâ€™t a penalty... how blind are yâ€™all 
Maybe the cooks pi should have been holding since it might have not been a catchable ball. I also haven't read the rulebook so what do I know.
It was catchable because he was being shoved out of bounds
The salt any time any penalty is called on the team playing the Pats is starting to pass amusing and is becoming a childish knee-jerk reaction.  Calm down adults.  
Jags are going to kill themselves by flags and lose lul
Hit to head, easy penalty there.  Bouye holding and pushing Cooks.  Jags get away with contact a lot but that much contact is most likely going to get called.  Call me a boner though, I know.
Why does the CB make that contact? Just dont let him come back to the ball and its an incompletion no flag?
Didn't try to make a play on the ball, he made a play on the player.
It was bad the second the Patriots were listed as a team playing this game. 
Reluctant upvote
Jags just threw us a life raft 
Gronk got hit in the head helmet to helmet which is an automatic unnecessary roughness, and bouye was blocking cooksâ€™ way to the ball
And their fans saying it's the refs fault. Lol
And they aren't even BS calls, I'd understand if they were
It was 4 blatant penalties in 1:30 all committed by JAX
"""The fix is in.""

Welcome to every Pats game thread.  "
When were the broncos in this game? 
After ignoring pass interference calls commuted against Gronk, finally the refs wake up a little.
How were either of those calls questionable? Honestly
omfg the haters. Someone explain how either of those calls were bad or unfair or should have been ignored please. 
Oh trust me, I grew up in Indianapolis so I get it completely. Middle school Colts fans in 2007 were brutal hahaha
I am not triggered at all, just funny that the pats canâ€™t get a flag without it being a fixed game. 
We really enjoy watching idiots like you desperately scramble for any petty made up excuse to deny that Pats earned every single one of them.
I know he was like "i gotcha fams". Fking cheating ass patriots
no that was fucked up. That doesn't justify anything 
I do, but I didn't just start watching football
"Questionable"
Agreed.
SHIPPIN UP TA BAWSTONNN
Just gotta ignore it overall. Every fan likes calls for their team and against the other or hates call against their team or for the opponent 
Well you are crying about the flags like the refs shouldn't be throwing them
He literally pushed him a quarter of the way across the field and out of bounds while the ball was in play. Easy call.
"lol yeah pushing him out of bounds while the ball is mid air is totally not interference

salt"
 Fuck you
This is the Chernobyl of game threads. Jesus Christ people
28-3
He shoved him out of bounds....
"People are just rightfully calling out that the NFL is rigged.





/s?"
How did your season end?
Sure it was uncatchable, that's what happens when you're being held and can't run the final 5 yards 
Welcome to r/nfl: where a blatant helmet to helmet isnâ€™t a penalty as long as itâ€™s against Gronk 
It was uncatchable because he was shoved out of bounds lol
It's irritating but I mean it's the natural response of most of reddit for any flag on the Pats opponents. You get numb to the bitching about refs. Kind of. 
Fuck off, lol. Those were beyond obvious penalties. Boye not only never even looked back at the ball, he hugged the receiver 30 yards down the field and forced him out of bounds. And helmet to helmet always gets flagged, especially on a tackle and when the safety isnâ€™t going for the ball.
I wish they came in earlier! 
"To people complaining about the refs, can you honestly tell me which of those flags was BS?

Playing aggressively on D is a double-edged sword"
"who cares about a bad hit!" I love how blinding the hatred of the Patriots makes this sub. 
You lost 35-14
"New England's been playing the long game. Gronk's been playing the fool for years to lower his baseline on the concussion tests.  
  
""What's 2+2?""  
""69, haha, nice.""  
""Yeah guys, he's normal, hand him a helmet."""
The DPI was. The Gronk hit wasn't 
Maybe teams should try not breaking the rules. 
Ref smiling as the pats get a touchdown....
It was a force out...thats a clear no go, you can't just angle into the sideline and body people out or that would happen on every deep route.
No the Pats totally rig games because the league totally loves us
It's abhorrent that any flag against a Patriots opponent is immediately reduced down to ridiculous conspiracies about staged games and corrupt referees.
ANYOnE ElSe DA REFs????  REEEEEE
Romo suspended 4 games and loses a pick?
"Yet people in here are blaming the refs.

If that Church hit was on Antonio Brown people would be crying bloody fucking murder."
And we're they bullshit penalties,?
I know I'm a pats fan but come on man, those were the right calls. 
Losers complain about refs.
Solid job supporting your team
It has to be catchable. I've noticed refs tend to give a lot of discretion on that definition as a hold/interference can have a lot of downstream effects that are hard to quantify.
I feel like I'm crazy reading this game thread. The PI MAYBE was weird, but he pushed him out of bounds before the ball got there. The Gronk hit to the head is clear as day a penalty.
He was calming them down from where I was sitting
Yes
nothing better than seeing how salty this thread is that the patriots scored, must hurt to see other teams have successðŸ˜‚
He thought boomer wanted a high five haha
The Jags got legit penalties on that drive. Not the refs fault they were undisciplined.
"""Bouye rides cooks like a donky out of bounds""

R/nfl ""Weak ass call!"""
Lmaooo yeah the refs definitely told him that ðŸ™„
Tony Romo is the best commentator in all of sports rn.
If you're going to play the "Seattle way" of grabbing every play and daring the refs to throw the flag, then you shouldn't be surprised when a flag is finally thrown.
"*something goes the patriots way*

/r/nfl: â€œRIGGED!!!â€"
You guys are fucking pathetic. Gronk gets blasted helmet to helmet, Cooks gets ridden out of bounds with 20 yards of contact, and you're bitching about the refs. Fuck off losers
"Lmao. Flair aside, ya'll motherfuckers are ridiculous.

Do you actually think the NFL would rig games for the pats.

Weak calls are weak calls but claiming that the NFL is rigging games for the team that's been the best for so long is just ludicrous.

inc downvotes for flair."
No he didn't. That was the definition of a penalty.
Piece of shit church, thats BS you can just take out a guy by helmet shotting em. 
He literally shoved him with his left  arm
Maybe the Jags shouldn't take a run at someone's head and then push a player out of bounds and they won't get penalties 
So many people wishing for Gronk to be injured in this thread. You disappoint me r/nfl.
Which one wasn't a penalty. The head to head hit or when the receiver got pushed out of bounds?
Let's keep going guys! Let's get this as toxic as last weeks gamethread /s
He said "he's going to say he's ok." As in Gronk will say he's ok
Thereâ€™s no doubt what Gronk did to White was dirty but that still doesnâ€™t make it okay to drill him in the head
It's because the hate. It's fine I question refs to but in games like this, you always double check just to be sure.
Yeah, what a plan to have Gronk get headhunted and Buoye shove cooks out of bounds mid pass.  Get your hate boner out of your eyes.
"its up to the defender to avoid helmet to helmet until the receiver can fully complete the catch.

literally like that for every team in the league"
Iâ€™m not complaining. Just got a TD from it
Fuck your dirty ass team. 
Salt levels rising...
"It's been fun guys, but this gamethread is only going to get worse here on out.

Good luck Jaguars, this is shaping up to be a hell of a game. See y'all in the postgame thread."
Did you even see the hit? Or Bouye straight up push Cooks out of bounds? 
If the team's were switched people would be applauding those calls.
Look through this thread 
fUcKiNg ChEaTrIoTs
Yeah the rule doesn't require intention if I'm not mistaken. It was helmet to helmet so call it by the book. If someone on the Pats did the same and got penalized I would be saying "that flag was fair" 
PI on a vertical route makes it almost impossible to determine what is uncatchable because of the amount of speed you lose.
The salt levels are so high in this thread. <Insert salt joke here.>
It was in the first quarter, when Jax wasn't committing them. 
There's no point arguing with them
He was responding to a Pats player arguing for a penalty on the Jags after the touchdown "I saw, I saw"
lol you guys are crazy. two actual penalties on a team that's being uppity and chippy as fuck and it's rigged. Sure just let them headhunt our best receiver or else we've paid off the refs.
Since fucking when do they NOT call helmet to helmet even for incidental hits? The penalty isnâ€™t for targeting, itâ€™s for any contact.  
Amazing how these guys are experts on flags only when they benefit the pats
Don't need to pretend. If it's a bad call I'll say so. Like the reversed TD call against Buffalo earlier this year.
why are blind people in the game thread
I believe he was referencing Gronk telling the fans he is ok.
wah wah wah Gronk and especially Hogan were held before and they didnt call it and even Romo said it was a BLATANT PI.
Pats about to make huge adjustments and outscore Jax 21-7 in half #2 and weâ€™ll win 31-21......... hopefully. 
Yeah, how is a 5'11 DB going to manage to hit a 6'6 man who is still in the air without aiming? HE DID NOT LEAD WITH HIS SHOULDER cause his shoulder doesn't go 6'6 into the air.
Jags are winning yet unraveling and becoming dirty as hell
The hate is real
He was pushed out of bounds, even Romo called it as it happened. 
But my played out narrative!
Ah man seems you've missed the memo, you can't actually know the rules in an /r/NFL game thread!
"Anyone who thinks the refs are in our favor can go suck my ass. 

Both of those were correct. Period"
The Jags literally celebrating a 15 yard penalty on a dirty headshot to Gronk. Rules gotta change, that shit should be an automatic ejection. And that was definitely PI, you can't just shove a receiver out of bounds 20 yards downfield
Uncatchable because he pushed cooks out of the way
Those werenâ€™t clear penalties to you?
Might as well. We wont see the ball again this half. Get him checked out and get him back on the field in the second half
So do y'all watch the game or do you just close your eyes and yell "rigged"?
You see 44 ripping White's facemask after the touchdown with no call?
Gets cranked in the head and is hurt, donâ€™t see how thatâ€™s soft 
So you're going to argue that clear helmet to helmet and then pushing a receiver OB and not letting them back in are bad calls? 
"He hit gronk in the head. It's not like gronk was low to the ground. He was still in the air. That means you basically have to try to do that. That's a definite penalty. 

The PI looked like PI in real time but when looking at the replay it looked like bouye just forced him out but grabbed unnecessarily at the end. That's a close call but i see why it could be called either way. 

"
Laumching helmet to helmet on an incomplete pass is questionable?
fuck man, why does CTV lags the the live thread, getting the game spoiled  
Theyâ€™re seeing pats jerseys lol
It was uncatchable because he got pushed out of bounds. Didnâ€™t even get a chance to look for the ball.
The amount of people crying â€œrefsâ€ in here is absurd. One blatant helmet to helmet and one where our WR was pushed out of bounds. Go fuck yourselves. 
the salt levels are rising in this thread 
Jags commit some dumb penalties tho
Pushing a player is though 
Jags vs. opposing player's heads
"If someone on the Patriots hit someone like how Church hit Gronk, /r/NFL would fucking riot.

But nooooooo this is /r/Patriots2 and everyone gives them breaks because Kraft is in cahoots with the officials."
Lmao Jags just taking knees 
Yeah but the initial contact was helmet to helmet so I don't know how that was leading with his shoulder.
Even without my homer glasses those were obvious.
Don't thank the NFL, thank the Jags defensive players who made those penalties.
I cant believe people here are disputing a PI call where the receiver ended uo out of bounds. Jacksonville secondary plays rough, it was the same way in Pitt,  I'm not knicking them cause it works but toure gonna draw penalties. The antipats circlejerk here is ridiculous
More like thank you Jax for causing those penalties
Gotta love that stupid nationwide commercial with the mini screen of the game behind it
"If we have to have commercials, can we have way more Lil' Sweet? He's awesome
"
Upvoting. Keep it coming =)
I do.
"This was my thought as well. 15 yards vs the opponents best player out of the game halfway through... easy decision.

Not saying defenders are *trying* to hurt players, but they certainly aren't incentivized not to."
Your team sucks, go jump through a table
Well the team playing against NE is committing penalties so the refs are obviously bought.
I feel like I'm in the twilight zone, I have never sewn this sub be so blindly biased. And any pats fans saying it was a good call are getting downvoted into oblivion. This game thread is nuts.
A dirty helmet-to-helmet hit on Gronk, and then blatant DPI pushing a receiver out of bounds on the route, but somehow it's the refs helping, and not Jags being dirty fucks.
Okay for real since when are you not allowed to shove a Patriots receiver out of bounds during his route tho? Fucking bullshit.
If you really think the NFL is rigged why do you even bother watching? 
">Reftriots

Ugh, that's an awful mash-up. How about Ref'reeots, if you want to go there?"
Jags quitting on the half... minute to go and no desire to go on
Bouye was odd. He did seem way too engage with Cooks though. Looked like he was almost standing on his toes
NFL is rigged obviously
And that punt. Why didn't they let the clock run longer?
R/NFL was edging itself for the whole first half waiting for a call and this thread just fucking exploded after that lmao
How is smiling cheering? He was trying to keep them from going after Jack since he had a hard tackle at the whistle and players were juiced up. He was just smiling while he was diffusing the situation. 
Just in time for margaritas
All of whom got called for PI
I know you just started watching football because you heard the Titans were good but that was PI.
If the NFL is rigged, why do you guys bother watching? 
cause he pushed him out of bounds
Jags
Are you serious? LOL. He never turned his head to the ball and hugged the receiver out of bounds while the ball was in the air. That was about as obvious PI as could exist.
And that just so happens to be good for your team too. Crazy.
LOL donâ€™t tackle before the catch
I really dont get it. These people cant be this fucking stupid. Both calls were correct. 
What about the refs? After denying the penalty in the endzone for driving White into the ground with the play already dead? Refs on the Jag's side today for sure
"If it favors the patriots it must be wrong, for they are the enemy.

-/r/patriots2 "
People in this thread think it isn't a penalty when a patriots player gets mugged and that the jags are allowed to hit helmet to helmet.
Them
Gillette stadium logo
Jags
I like that too. 
He also punched Lewis on a previous play
Heâ€™s supposed to wrap up and not target his head
Yags
Helmet to helmet, and shoving a guy out of bounds when the ball is in the air. What a gift.
One of the linemen bumped into him and started immediately apologizing but sure, paid for.
Yeah, let's forget that he was pushed outside
agree
Yes Patriots!! It's close now!!!
Seriously, sure the refs threw the flags by both of those were dumb to take on defence.
You mean like the Pats not literally shoving receivers out of bounds? Come on, man. 
The jags are acting like the seahawks
Because he went helmet to helmet....
Bullshit drive? They went headhunting?
"*Flag goes off against Pats* 
""That flag is justified, better yet, they should have killed that pats player for it.""

*Flag goes off against anyone else*
""The refs are winning this game for the pats, no wonder the NFL is going down in ratings."""
It isn't fair though, Gronk wouldn't be able to answer that on his best day...
I'm going to be so fucking mad if GRONK is out. Fuck that helmet to helmet 
Wow this thread is drowning in salt 
We got ourselves a ballgame!
"Jags had us but now I feel good
"
Jags
I cannot believe they didn't try to get into field goal range, damn. 
Helmet to helmet is not leading with the shoulder. Gronk didn't magically become a giant
You forgot snobby as well
It's obviously rigged though... right?
Losers mentality not having a go there with a time out
I love salty "fans" who have no idea how pass interference actually works.
Pats should have called the time out to make them run back
"Holy fuck, here we go with the refs...

1) Yes, they should have blown the DOG down before the snap. They didn't, and the play didn't count. Other than being procedurally incorrect, what was wrong with then enforcing the penalty? It's not as if getting the snap off suddenly negates the penalty - there was a delay of game, and the refs were late enforcing it. The fact that there was a penalty is the key, though, so it should have been enforced.

2) We all agree on Gronk. Don't hit him in the head.

3) The DPI - unnecessary contact about half an hour early, and forced Cooks out of bounds. While the defence is free to have his space, he can't make early contact and force Cooks out. It's DPI.

I know we all hate the refs because they're bought and paid for, but how can any of those three penalties really be disputed (other than the delay of game, which, again, was just a matter of the refs being late - it was still clearly a penalty). Can I ask what is incorrect with any of those calls?"
Upvote.
Nobody should be wishing any player gets hurt. What a disgraceful thing just say. Don't act like he is the first player to have some kind of dirty hit on another player. Wishing injury upon any player on any team is absolutely disgusting.
What a cowardly strategy 
For all the shit that went against us in the first half, I'm feeling pretty good. If we can come out of the 2nd half and get a stop then I *really* like our chances. 
Bitch move not trying before half that will cost them
Stfu 
"All hits cause CTE. And I wasnâ€™t just talking about CTE. Have you had a concussion? They arenâ€™t fun. Not only is it an absolutely unnecessary brain injury, but it also takes players out of the game for no fucking reason. If you root for player injuries of any kind, or donâ€™t want to take steps to reduce them, then youâ€™re a shit person. 

And flair up if you want to be in here talking shit. "
Holy shit you guys are fucked. Helmet to helmet hits are penalties! Just because there's a flying Elvis on the helmet doesn't suddenly make it a fix
Lmao Jags dirty as fuck. Hitting someone in the head and the be proud of it.
"For the day we fall

Which will be a long time"
Lol how is targeting head to head a no call.
Yeah thatâ€™s why he got suspended 
"lol this game thread. Brady dialed up the Flacco special, yet the pats bought out the refs.

Also people talking about two questionable calls on that drive? There was a helmet to helmet hit. Or are y'all new to the game or something?"
Hope someone targets Fournette with a nice clean hit 
Lol you just proved your point wrong.  The fact that Gronk has 7 inches on Church makes it **harder** to incedentally hit him in the helmet.  He led high, probably gave Gronk a concussion, and then celebrated it after.  
Why not go for a score with 1min????????
I know they're jaguars but they don't need to be pussies
Cause he pushed him out of bounds right before
If I was Bill I'd call a T.O at 1sec, just so that the Jags had to run back out.
"Dude it's refball out there!
"
Half the kids in this thread don't seem to have composure to watch.
I mean don't commit obvious af penalties.  Gronk dropped it anyways, and Brady overthrew Cooks.  Unnecessary penalties.
Nope, cheaters
Cuz patriots 
Can I get that salt on my crackers?
Dominated?  WTF?  
His arms were draped over him as the ball came down gtfo 
Jags actually kneeled it out with 50 seconds and 2 timeouts? Hahahaha
no sane fan defended that play, not even pats fans.
Jags are a bunch of thugs
It was a fucking force out, read the fucking rulebook.
Had high hopes for this game thread but I can see this is into 110% toxicity status 
I give it a 1% chance that Gronk gets pulled from the game. 
"> Refs can't be more blantely paid off.

Are you kidding? The only penalties called so far was an illegal shot to the head, tackling a DE for a hold, and pushing someone out of bounds for DPI. What is paid off about that?"
He was pushing him out of bounds well after 5 yards.
Even Marrone says the helmet to helmet was a good call for you fans.
This has been one of the worst threads I have ever been in
They were beating us before those penalties, no need to play dirty.
Nope. We get all the calls. Like the Hogan in where Gipson is riding him like a horse. We did get that one right?
Lol he hit a defenseless receiver in the head. You sound ridiculous. 
No shit. Our second best player got knocked out of the game on a dirty hit and somehow the Jags are the victims here. Fuck outta here r/nfl.
Lol are you for real right now
Dont commit penalties if you dont want them called maybe? 
maybe someone said something funny. relax
I'm sorry, there's just no way you hit Gronk that high without trying. It's not even the best way to bring him down. Fuck that Sucks, it changes everything. 
It's a conspiracy everyone
Incidental saves him from a fine, not a penalty. 
All things considered, this isn't the worst. We can't shut down Fournette, Yeldon, or their beastly DL, but if we make adjustments we'll be fine.
You're why everyone hates our fans. 
"Nut up buttercup

Got a half left "
AMA Doug Marrone's sunglasses
The GOAT commentator everyone
More likely the pats will after that heinous helmet to helmet. Grow up if you think that was clean. 
We would be 0-16 without the refs according to this sub.
No he's supposed to hit him in the body a day blow the pass up, gronk had no chance of holding on through the hit. Problem was he initiated contact helmet to helmet
Good game so far. Dirty play notwithstanding, Jags showed up so far
The amount of salt in this thread is astonishing. Both big penalties that drive were correct calls and it's not close. People just fucking salty because Pats.
Lucky isn't the right word, but this game is closer than it feels and New England is lucky to be within 4.
Thanks.  I'm glad the NFL has been fixing these games for us for 16 years.
Who cares, TD. Forced jags to commit penalties. 
I hope gronk comes back and gives church the tredavious white treatment. 
Hitting him in the head surely made it not a catchable ball
Obvious troll
lol Marrone had to take the shades off for a second
PHIL SIMMS IS BETTER THAN TONY ROMO -guy near camera, 2018
Lol even your coach says it was a good call and yâ€™all will still cry about it.
"You cannot push a fucking receiver out of bounds on his route.

That's how."
Yeah, penalizing blatant unnecessary roughness and holding is BULLSHIT.
"You heard the coach, helmet to helmet was a good call 
PI is always bullshit "
we're going to the superbowl 
Hey look, even Marrone said the helmet to helmet was a good call. 
Every fucking team in league history has bullshit calls handed their way. Yeah whatever the refs gave us that for free, doesn't mean there's cheating or money going on. Fuckin hell. 
Doug, who you lookin at?
Lol these penalties were so clear tho damn 
If you didn't rule by spot the of foul, why wouldn't a team execute DPI on every single long pass? Better to lose a few yards than give up a long play.
"> And church should be elected for celebrating that hit on gronk

That celebration made me so fucking angry."
Yeah man. These fucking refs are such pussies. They should just ignore blatant holding and helmet to helmet hits! Calling these obvious penalties is just giving the Pats an unfair advantage.
Yeah, it's totally the Pats fault the Jags are unraveling and committing penalties
"Yep. If itâ€™s a somewhat questionable call I understand the hate, but both were EXTREMELY blatant. 

Even the Jags coach just now said the helmet to helmet hit was a good call, but Iâ€™ve seen AFC East fans going berserk over that one and saying the fix is in. "
lmao literally two posts down from this.
Doug Marrone said the refs got the call right. What's this thread going to do now that even the opposing head coach isn't calling for the fix? You guys must be so lost!
r/NFL contemplating whether to upvote a Patriots hating comment or downvote a negative Romo comment.
Wow, 55 seconds and 2 timeouts...take 2 knees. That's not how you beat us 
I know they deferred but this seems overly conservative by Jacksonville.
I agree with this. Should be 15 max. 
Two TOs with 55s and you take a knee? 
Bro we are down 4 at half. WTF?
They were chippy before the penalties. and they actually committed penalties...
It is when you shove him out.
Keep watching
People whining. Stfu, jags literally took out our best offensive weapon with a dirty hit. It's become a strategy to injure gronk and its getting old. 
It is when you force him out and don't let him back in to make a play on the ball
"It was uncatchable because the CB hugged the WR forcing him out of bounds and and never even looked back at the ball.

Yâ€™all need to get over your hate of the Pats and look at that play objectively."
Keep it up and we'll need something to balance the seasoning
lmao. Two blatant DPIs and a helmet-to-helmet hit on the best TE of all time. FOH
Yeah if Gronk was shorter the DB would have flown right over him as is proper tackling form.
Right, a shot to the head sending a player to the locker room is â€œplaying hardâ€
"what the fuck are you on?

so if Gronk is shorter Church only hits him in the head with his shoulder? "
Or they were the correct calls? 
2 questionable penalties? Are blatant dirty helmet to helmet hits questionable biw
Gronk will b fine, Brady will give him the concussion water
For fucks sake, Even their coach agrees the helmet to helmet was the right call.
No pls 
I thought the PI was initiated before the ball was close though. Thats the way I see it.
I get this entire subreddit despises the Patriots for inexplicable reasons, but where are all these termites coming from claiming a helmet to helmet hit being called is "clearly the refs being paid off"?
Knowing them, yes.
Ah dumb clock management then. Didn't seem to make a difference though, last minute was kneeling
Catchable if he wasn't shoved out of bounds before the ball was close. 
"Packers fan complaining about calls.

Refs bail out packers all season long."
But good for Bitcoin
because Cooks was shoved out of bounds lol
"The helmet to helmet on Gronk was a rotten hit. Should've resulted in an ejection. 

edit: fine, looks more bang-bang on that replay. I concede that point. "
As much of a joke as the concussion protocol is I wouldnt be surprised if they could talk gronk back onto the field
Patriots
or you can be sensible and think that both are disgusting and terrible?
Calling for the fix is insane. All of that was right, Idc if I get called a Homer. I do question that White got out of bounds around 1:28 though
Pssfff, you dont think CTE inducing helmet to helmet hits on a defenseless receiver are legit? 
You sure? All the pats comments I see are up to -25
It's cancer. Every game thread this shit happens
Gotta at least give him a chance to catch the ball. Can't push him out of bounds 1 second before the ball gets there. No way he would have caught it but it was a bonehead move.
Bye
He was pushed out of bounds....
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Obvious calls.  Keep crying though.
Calling it now. Whoever wins this game will win the superbowl. Both teams look solid.
Lick it baby   :)
Youâ€™re delusional 
Everyone saying the two most blatant calls possible are ref ball can suck my dick. 
Two time outs and they take a knee smh.
No it needs to be spot or else anytime a CB gets beat he'll just tackle the shit out of the guy
"YOU CANT PUSH A WR OUT OF BOUNDS REGARDLESS OF HOW CATCHABLE THE BALL IS

JESUS FUCKING CHRIST"
"People crying about those penalties lmao. Feed me your tears hahaha. Butthurt clowns.

Edit: butthurt clowns right on schedule ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
But it was a delay and their were whistles during the entire play but no one stopped.
Donâ€™t hit the receivers helmet with your helmet. Pretty easy.
How do you people in this thread defend a helmet to helmet hit on someone who is 6'6"?  That was completely obvious... 
Ooh jags with the soft move, I'll take it.
Jacksonville concusses Gronk then pushes Cooks out of bounds on a deep ball, neither should have been penalties apparently
The one time he loses his mind?  You have Tyreek Hill on your roster. 
Down by 4 isn't terrible considering how we played. BB is the best at making halftime adjustments, let's fucking go.
Welcome to the Patriots game thread, where the refs are paid, the balls are deflated, and everyone is salty.
Is that what that guy said? LOL
Head jags coach literally just called it a good call, so everyone saying refs have been paid off are the ones with the blinders on lol
Tackle the fucking legs.  How is hitting Gronk up high suppose to get it him down?
He got shoved out of bounds away from the play while the ball was in the air.  How was that bs?
Agreed. I know im biased, but its a fairly officiated game so far. Also, Im not sleeping on the jags enough to start talking about stories yet haha.
You can run beside them but you can't physically push them out like Bouye did. 
You're not supposed to hit high. I don't think it was malicious though.
He basically pushed him out of bounds 30 yards down the field after he was targeted with the ball. Blatant PI.
Not saying the Church hit was dirty. But it was reckless and defo a penalty.
Patriots hate turns 90% of this sub into fucking morons. Good calls, stop being salty about it.
Your tin foil is too tight man
Cowardly way to end the half. Gotta play to win. 
It really isn't that complicated. It doesn't matter if the pass was catchable. DBs can't push WRs out of bounds. Do people here even read the rules?
2nd week in a row of whining about refs since every one wants patriots to lose so when we start scoring makes them sad
Helmet to helmet is a legit call. Pass interference was iffy, but he was pushed out and that'll get called 10 times out of 10, regardless of the team. These calls happen to EVERY. OTHER. TEAM. and it's normal to you guys, but when it favors the Patriots it's us paying the refs. 
Maybe because Bouye was pushing him out of bounds?
Not dirty but still a penalty 
maybe if they didnt act so brainless they would've been in a better spot lol
Both were legit calls, stop whining. 
Your fanbase is so much classier than ours.  I'm envious.
I hate that Verizon commercial.
"I was born and raised in Boston man


Pick a team and stop skirting the edge "
That's how it goes when a circlejerked team is going against the Pats
They always are. Usually just both teams taking turns blaming the refs
About to?
That's the point of why it's a foul. He has a 6 foot 8 range to hit him. And he goes high to hit him in the head. 
Jags
This sub could talk themselves into rationalizing the murder of a patriots player on national television. 
Uhh any other way rather than intentionally aim his head at his head.
i'll probably get downvoted but i don't feel like church's hit to the helmet was intentional. he had already built up momentum for the hit, and gronk started to lean/head down and thus church's helmet connected. if gronk had stayed upright the hit would've been on his shoulder. 
he plays for the patriots.
Enjoy your bath salts and poverty
At this point I hope so
Yeah when thereâ€™s pass interference it probably will be uncatchableðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
you misspelled refs /s
Lol their coach too.. that was definitely a good call he led woh the helmet and the only part to hit was the helmet. 
Verizon or Chevy commercials?
â€œAs high as he couldâ€ aka his head. Which is the penalty. My toaster strudel could figure that out. 
Jags playing not to lose 
I hope not but if he's got a concussion he needs to sit. I doubt it's going to happen because they don't give a shit about safety, just the illusion of safety.
You're delusional
People like you is why everyone hates pats fans. Come on man.
jags
Well sure, of course it wasn't after the defender pushed him out of the field of play.
A Patriots game will do that to you ðŸ˜‚
Yes it is when itâ€™s a defenseless receiver lol 
That was some asshole playing in that last drive. Their defense is already good, they don't need to do that garbage. 
PI is PI, what a dumb fucking take
Jags
Pats hate
Because they're committing penalties
TIL a blatant helmet to helmet hit is a bullshit flag. 
Fuck off Gregg Williams.
Jungle Kittens
I love Silicon Valley so much, but these fucking non stop Verizon ads through the year are really making me hate Tom Middleditch
They're unfair because they benefit us. 
Hey look, someone with sense. 
Jags.
So uh where were the refs for any of those Jags TD drives?
"Boo hoo?" Lol nobody's crying. It's funny
Here come all the people bitching about the refs. Don't blame them for calling the penalties blame the jags for committing them
"Gillette Stadium logo  
   
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/Gillettestadiumlogo.png"
And give Church a nice little bonus right?  There's no way you hit Gronk helmet to helmet unless you are trying to.
It was ten yards away because he pushed Cooks out of bounds...
How could he possibly have hit him head to head if he didnâ€™t lead with his head
Yeah idk what Bouye was thinking 
"Because Patriots.

Because the league is somehow simultaneously in their pocket but also not letting them ""get away"" with the ideal gas law."
the ball wasn't uncatchable, it landed in bounds. The CB had his hands on the Receiver the ENTIRE FUCKING time. Last i checked, they were literally 30 yards down field. 
"You're right. The refs told Church to aim high on his hit and also made Bouye push Cooks out of bounds on his route. Oh, yeah, and they let White sneak right in for the TD.

""refball""...give me a fucking break."
It never matters what hits first
Which call would you disagree with?
Menawhile Gronk is dead and Cooks is getting pushed completely out of bounds still. Yeah... Refs are giving it to the Pats. Be happy we gave you Jimmy. You're welcome
Apparently 90% of the people in this thread are blind
And which call was incorrect?
Barry church should be ejected fuck him
Could have gotten there if he want ridden out of bounds by bouye
Classy response from Marrone. Respect.
It's almost like they are really good on capitalizing on other team's mistakes. 
It was. There was 210 left. They rushed up to punt it. The clock starts on the ball being ready for play after a declined penalty. It doesnâ€™t keep running while the ref is announcing the penalty
Straight up freezer fresh hungry man dinner sodium levels in here
Every penalty against the opponent means the fix is in, don't you know?
"I was really angry atthe first half of ur comment. 

Im not saying that it was intentional in the least but something more than 15 yards for the player. "
Stop watching football please you know nothing about it was a helmet to helmet hit you dumb fuck
People hate the pats.
Why? If it didn't interfere cooks may have had a td
Wtf?
Lol pats fans are getting as many down votes
"But the lack of â€œbig hitsâ€ are killing the game. /s

Fuck people. Itâ€™s already a violent ass sport. Anything we can do to limit the amount of damage these **people** take should be done. "
We were going for it, but then they hurt Gronk and Brady got mad.
"Yeah, really uncharacteristic.  Hit gronk in the midsection and he still drops that pass, and then you're never stuck with a force out to avoid getting burned on the go route.

Still the smart play by bouye to force him out, its a touchdown otherwise so it at least gives them a chance."
Sorry but it was DPI whichever way you look at it. You can't interrupt a receivers' route like that beyond 5 yards from the line of scrimmage.
No he was pushing Fleming away because he was pissed off about the late hit on White at the end. 
Serious question.   How?  Cooks got pushed out of bounds.  How is that not p.i. with the ball in the air?
If only the 31 other billionaire owners knew how to buy off the refs.
Can someone explain to me why the refs would side with NE when we are the most hated team by literally everyone outside of NE?
Jags aint even gonna try to put more points on the board? I dont think I have ever seen a team run off the field with that much time on the clock.
Yall are salty motherfuckers man.
not enough, mr kraft better starts writing that check! 
No, the jags handed them that td...the helmet to helmet gets called every time. Plus the PI where he pushes Cookie out of bounds....but yeah damn you refs for calling those penalties! 
You need to find your meds, or is this the first Patriots game you've ever seen?
Because the dB grabbed him. It looks much more uncatchable than it actually was. Ball landed on the five and the dpi was at the fifteen. He interfered with him early so it looks like it was uncatchable. At that point it is a judgement call. 
This is a friendly, christian thread.
Looked like his hands were inside to me. But, Ill have to watch the replay.
It was a helmet to helmet hit on a defenseless receiver. In what universe wasn't it dirty? Oh yeah, in the universe that it was against Gronk
Refs didn't make the jags quit on the first half
... lolwut
Nope, that is how it works here. The Pats have been good for so long that 80% of teams feel slighted. So you get these huge waves now that will just cheer any anti-patriot thing. It doesn't matter that it was literally the textbook launching at a defenseless WR with a head to head hit.
At what point was the hit on Gronk targeting and an ejection? Iâ€™m thinking mostly through CFB. Is it because heâ€™s big and tall? That they donâ€™t want to go down that road? Or am I missing some rule interpretation?
If hes pushed out yes
Celtic Punk isnt bad, but shipping up to boston is by far the most overplayed song and I wish we could time travel to remove it from the records after the first year of its existence
Yeah, even while watching it live you see the clock hit 0 before they snap the ball. If you want to rewatch it go ahead. The play clock hits 0 before the ball is snapped
He was mauling him for days. Thatâ€™s a catchable ball without it.
He would have been able to run at full speed for about 3 more seconds, so yeah I think that's an easy call
Did he before though? 
We are terrible people and the worst fans, didn't you know?
Balls tend to be uncatchable when you run receivers off their route out of bounds.
Jags literally up 4 at halftime and yet somehow the refs are in the bag for the Pats.
Honestly, it's strange to me that a headshot, intentional or not, isn't an automatic ejection. If you hit the head as the main point of contact you should be gone. 
Everyone condemned that though. Suggesting a player deserves an injury would seem to forfeit the moral high ground.
Explain to me how those penalties are not penalties. Was there not video proof?
Hopefully that cheap shot doesn't change this game.
Haha Jags, we coming back
Cam newton came back. Gronk was able to actually walk to the sideline
You seriously trying to justify that?
Even the Jags coach said the helmet to helmet was a good call. Not /r/NFL though, clean as fuck bro! 
"Gronk should NOT come back into this game

But the concussion protocol is a joke so he'll probably be back"
The calls were fine, last week was way, way shadier. 
You have to be some kind of serious Salt Monster to think that Gronk hit was a soft call.
Hit him in the chest. 
I'm done with this game thread. Every Pats game thread goes to "Kraft's wire transfer appreciation thread" after Pats get a few calls.
It's butt hurt losers
Agreed. Whenever I hear shipping up to Boston I just want to stab something into my ears.
Here's a hot idea - don't fucking launch yourself at Gronks head. And don't fucking maul Cooks out of bounds. You don't get penalized if you don't fucking commit penalties. 
Shoved him out of bounds easiest dpi to call
Bro it was a clear helmet to helmet like literally clear as fucking day 
Don't even bother dude
You aren't allowed to go helmet to helmet. There are many ways to hit someone without drilling their head
I couldn't agree more
Salty fuck, gonna feel nice when we curb stop Jags in second half
Jack has been aggressive after the play a couple of times now
If they let cam Newton back in they will let grok back in right? 
If it is uncatchable because of the penalty then sure
"No those calls were correct. 

You are right though, we need to get our shit together. Don't blame the refs for the Jags being undisciplined"
â€œYup, heâ€™s fine.â€
/s?
Every last person on the planet would think those are good calls if it happened to their own team.
Yup. He's on the payroll. Gets paid in gift certificates to Patriot Place.
Please convince your fellow Bills fans, seems like youâ€™re the only one with eyes. 
Prevent defense
He hit burkehead perfectly with the shoulder. Come on that was a scumbag hit. Get over it
"The ball was uncatchable due to the hold.

Call was ticky tacky, yes, but the reason the flag was thrown was because the ball landed in bounds. If the ball sailed out of bounds I doubt a flag wouldâ€™ve been thrown"
"He has to ask him a question he'd know _before_ the hit though.

Doctor: What's your favorite number?

Gronk: (anything but 69)

Doctor: Jesus, get this man to a neurologist. Stat!"
I just rewound to watch it again.  That's crazy.
For real. Ridiculous 
thanks magic
I need to see a replay, but when I saw the play it looked like the defensive guy pushed him out of bounds.
I do not.
Or laughing because he didnâ€™t call the blatant  unsportsmanlike after the TD
Obviously biased, but did that tackle in the end zone end with a swipe at his head? 
shoulder to chest? hahahahahaha blind moron
(penalty which was penalty)
Then defensively the obvious play is to ALWAYS foul on deep balls that look close because a 15 yard penalty is better than a 40 yard completion. The rule is the way it is for a reason. 
Dolphins: At home
You must be new here.
"Pretty sure he was talking to the Patriots player who wanted a flag on the Jags defender who threw a sissy punch because he got his ass handed to him in the end zone.



Maybe."
"ITT: People saying the helmet hit on Gronk shouldn't have been a penalty.

/r/nfl, you've hit a new low of blind hatred."
"Well, at least you can lose gracefully.

God bless.  :)"
What was dumb about the comment?
Thereâ€™s a difference between playing hard and playing like assholes and that last drive was a complete breakdown of discipline by the jags. The Gronk his was blatant. Which led he refs to favor Cooks on the PI and then they threw White to the ground after the play was over. Play hard. Hit hard. But play clean. 
Iâ€™m not an organization
Because Gronk being out benefits them, DPI doesn't
Nice to see a neutral fan say this. The only reason theyâ€™re not penalties is because itâ€™s the Pats.
Jumping on another play was bad for sure (he should have gotten suspended for longer), but this man just sprinted into a helmet to helmet collision. You can't defend that.
Its the lighthouse and bridge. Yeah its weird.
So Counterpart is Starzâ€™ version of Fringe?
Itâ€™s fucking gross. 
A dirty hit that took out our best receiver. Fuck that dirty ass.
Both penalties were correct. One literally took a guy out.
The hit to the head and delay of game penalties are undisputable. The DPI was questionable but why even put yourself in that position as a defender?
Romo did too lol and he's always against us 
What. it hasn't already?
Lol, made me laugh reading through all the BS
OOOoooooEEERRRgghhHHHHHHH
I think it was more that the ref thought Cooks was pushed out of bounds.
do y'all think we'll see gronk back out there after the half?
They have a history, see most recently: Bills game. Dirty fucking team. 
"Bouye at no point turned his head to play the ball, meanwhile he has both hands on the receiver 40 yards beyond the LOS and drives him out of bounds when the ball is ten yards from him and the receiver.

Bitch all you want but that was just as easy of a call as the helmet to helmet. "
Really a sad look for the subreddit
Jacksonville cheats unlike the Patriots
You know that, like, 70% of the human body is in between those two areas right?
Random question: Would it be PI if the defender just stopped short with the receiver behind him to try to disrupt the receiver
I'm so jealous of Romo's tremendous career. 
No one has forgotten that. He did his time and paid his fines. 
Thank you! 
Not if we're down 35 - 10 at the end of the 3rd tho
"Now that itâ€™s halftime I just want to rant about something:

Fuck everyone cheering on injuries! Whether itâ€™s all the people who cheered gronks injury or some people on our side doing the opposite. Fuck all of yâ€™all end of discussion. 

/rant"
Hey guys it was great spending time with y'all. I'm going to get out of this thread now before I start making dickhead comments.
Chevy/Ford commercials, any negative news about the President, and that "what's a computer" bitch.
no it landed in the end zone IIRC though close to the end of it so actually I would need a replay to say for sure
If he had been allowed to make a play on it, it would have been catchable.  Corner took Cooks right out of the play.
It would have been catchable if he wasn't pushed out of bounds by the DB... can run to the ball if you're getting molested
It's called "The Flacco"
I would for sure.
Because he was shoved out of bounds
Jags had a chance to go from humble losers to humble winning team fans. Instead they choose to just become the whinest fans. 
Kneeling before half with two timeouts was gutless 
Gronk isn't talking, the rules are. He got suspended for his hit
I know we clearly paid your defense to try and illegally take gronk out of the game and commit obvious penalties like shoving cooks out of bounds so he can't even try for the ball.
Youâ€™re a fucking idiot
Why would you not go for two points, NE?!  The difference between being down by 4 or 5 is nothing... why not try to make it down by 3?
you can play a lot more aggressive because there is less time for the opposing team to score if you they get the ball.
Yeah, I forgot the "Headbutting now totally okay" rule
The question is if he can spell his own name on any given moment
">At worst it was a guy trying to make a big hit that ended up hitting a bit too high.

Gronk is 6'6"". The guy who laid the hit isn't even 6-foot tall. It is literally impossible to deliver a helmet-to-helmet unless he was very aggressively going for specifically that."
The helmets hit just about at the same time as the shoulders. That is and has been illegal every single time. You don't aim high, and definitely not when the receiver doesn't have time to react.
Gronk be okay baby , fuck the haters 
I hope we get every weak call for us so that everyones head in this thread can explode. 
I haven't been following just curious why
Anything against the Jags is BS obviously
Because fights happen. Then the media starts doing shock and awe reports. Then the NFL looks bad
because of the dpi...
To your first point, I agree. To your second, fuck you with hot rusty nails.
Na, Pats cheat
Cause he didn't run out of bounds. Opposing player had hands on him and forced him away from the ball
Then the fact that they're your flair makes that even sadder
It's like Dems vs Rep in here. Legit call or not doesn't matter they'll call it rigged
It's almost like there is 70% of the player between their shoulders and thighs.
When you shoved someone out of bounds itâ€™s a flag
So that means its okay to celebrate injuring someone?  How does that make any sense to you?
Pats games always drag out the biggest trolls and degenerates. 
Yeah clearly. The NFL paid Church to helmet-smash Gronk and paid Bouye to shove Cooks out of bounds. Gimme a fucking break.
I don't know if it was dirty, but it was clearly helmet-to-helmet and called correctly.
Classless team dude what do you expect 
What I hear is "I'm all for protecting the players, unless I don't like the result"
I'm going to apologize here. Upon rereading your original comment it does look like you may have been complaining about your team committing the penalties. Got mixed up with all the other complaining about the refs.
Wahhhhh my team sucks dick so I have to accuse other fans of being band wagon fans wahhhhh
You must be new here
He pushed a receiver out of bounds while the ball was in the air
"he didn't lead with his shoulder, he lead with his helmet

that's, you know, why there was a flag

"
Mods - I wish you good fortune in the salt wars to come. 
It's pretty bullshit to get hit and being kept off the rest of the game
You are the worst kind of person. 
this is said in every thread and we believe this too...yet it's only talked about when the Pats get them!
I guess thats one way of taking Gronk out of the game...
It's a winning complex. Better than conjuring conspiracy fantasies for sure.
Seriously it's like Dems after Clinton Lost. 
He was pushing cooks out of bounds.
Thanks for the insight Jeff. 
Turn away unless you're salty and butthurt and think the pats are rigging the nfl. This thread is toxic
Ehh, they were starting to move it pretty well despite the flags I think. Even some unusual drops from Gronk. I hope he can come back.
These game threads move way too fast to have a 2-way discussion.
A 3rd down stop!!!!
It's at the point where I'm expecting every one of his passes to be a completion.
Nice kick.
That happens to Chung every now and then
Nice kick. Let's come back strong
That was a real nice kick
Could've been good from 64
Oh shit care for the fake
Great kick but just a 7 point game. If Pats can go answer then that would be huge. 
Romo is hyped
Goddamn 
Man, that was a pretty kick.
Lambo makes it look easy.
Nah I cannot handle mayo. Think its the texture more than anything.
He really likes the left side of the uprights today. 
It's a mix of that, and then when they get a penalty, OMG THE REFS. It's the worst
Well that was an excellent kick.
Big drive 
Money from 54... big kick right there. 
He made that 54 yard field goal look easy.
Pretty much, they tend to start fairly civil, then a call goes the pats way and the entire thread become dominated by claims that the patriots pay off the refs, then the pats start playing better after half and the threads became dominated by obnoxious pats fans saying shit like â€œ huh huh, did the refs cause that touchdownâ€
That's why you werent a WR Flowers
Romo is so hyped I love it
Laser of a FG
Chargers fans on suicide watch
Offense needs o give the D some rest.
Did Tomo have to much sugar?
That "It'sss PERFECT."
54 yds
Not 20 seconds later, after the penalty was announced.
Orgasm
:)
Perfect down the middle lol
54
"The concussion protocol is a joke and has been. If they were serious, Gronk would be out. But no way they keep him out of a game this big.

That said, Gronk is an adult and knows what he is signing up for. "
Anybody wearing pants that aren't brown?
I liked Romo at first, but he's been a bit too much in the playoffs.
54
Who says shit like this?
What a boot on Lambo
It's funny hearing a 49er fan talking about COL
54
I'm looking forward to it. 
Gutsy call on the FG. Nice kick. 
Romo might actually think that he is on the Jags 
Bad franchise
Are streams really so far behind the broadcast or is reddit dying?
If you ever make it to CT (you're not missing much)... Abbott's Lobster in the Rough. Life changing & wallet draining.

YESSSSSS OMG. I legit thought they'd get that conversion 
HAHAHA fourth down
Kickers so good now I don't expect a miss unless it's 60+ yards
Stephon Gilmore had a lot of trouble getting used to Patricia's playbook in a timely fashion, I'm not looking forward to him having to do it all over again
Lol
a 3rd down stop i couldnt believe it!!
Yea 
One already has... 
The ref had called the penalty and he was STILL celebrating... That's just stupid. 
"Pats are down-
â€œha easiest road to playoffs. Bunch of chumpsâ€

Flag against Jax-
â€œhere we go, give them the gameâ€

Flag against Pats-
â€œrefs gotta at least make it look fairâ€

No matter what, r/nfl hates the Pats"
You came here for discussion? This is just diarrea of the /r/nfl hive mind
"""These calls happen to EVERY. OTHER. TEAM. and it's normal to you guys, but when it favors the Patriots it's us paying the refs."" - my first comment


""You're being delusional"" - your first comment

That's literally saying we pay the refs."
Fawkkk
I see this and I'm judging you
Apparently he's Justin from *from Justin to Kelly* 
Wouldnt think someone so damn big could do it
Gronk needs to come back ASAP 
I don't think they will stop hating us anyways.
These are the people known colloquially as "haters" and "trash" by rap and country respectively. 
Pretty dangerous though. He seems to leave his leg out there, got hurt last week doing that.
honestly id be fine with just the half a trillion dollars
I feel like a 50+ yard FG used to be a big deal but kickers hit them all the time now. Am I wrong?
54
LOL
Beautiful kick
Regardless of our differences as patriots fans or jaguars fans, I think we can all agree: San Diego was fucking stupid to get rid of Lambo.
tony is so fucking excited
Harry Potter name
"Gronk is a lot of it. He can both run block for power and spread, and we got some do everything running backs that could do it.

I'd say you tire out the defense more not letting the sub since you dictate pace and play, but Gronk being out probably renders it moot. "
Not surprised tbh.
Same
Thank god we held them to a fg.
"Um
 What? No"
Fans bitching about good calls never gets old
Dirty Play 17
Not a hold at all...
Dang that was perfectly placed
Ive seen cbs get called Comericals Before Sports 
literally holding his arm.
Good bot
Romo sounds like such a nice guy
You really want the refs to start throwing flags for that?
Bouye grabbed his arm
DB is clearly hooking Cooks' arm there. And people say refs favor NE...
Little hand holding there the refs let slide. 
Yeah he didn't need use of his arms there
Wow again bouye is holding his arm down and no call.
No pi 
How is that not a PI?????
OW character who is in the film
Bouye locking Cooks' arm. Fine with a no call, but it could've been for sure. 
Dammit 
Holding his arm the entire time.. thought Pats got all the calls
holy shit that throw was perfect but why would you throw into double coverge like that
Let's just hold Cooks left arm the whole time...
He grabbed his arm 3 seconds before the ball arrived.
but guys, the refs favour the pats
Refball lol
Yeah get Hogan more involved
I guess holding the arms is legal.  
No flag? RIGGED!!!
Out if context, linebacker threw RB to the ground 5 yards into the end zone and the Tackle was getting into with him. Ref was laughing and pushing him back.
That ball spin tho.
They cut away from him celebrating, not the play.
"Yeah guys look how much the refs favor the patriots

Literally holding him arm to his side lmfao"
You spin that ball crazy eyes
Ok well then glad weâ€™ve reached a place where youâ€™re pretty much saying â€œI didnâ€™t say anything meaningfulâ€
ad and gluten free
LOL you just got away with PI. Jax fans are clowns
Damnit Cooks gotta make that 
Nice obvious PI
Honestly, yeah. 
Cooks, never wins Thoes contested balls
He was holding his arm down, come on refs, /r/nfl told me you were rigging the game for us, whwreâ€™s the call?
ramsey hooking cooks arm tho
Is holding receivers arm the new DB strat? I swear I'm seeing it all the time now
I've always said the defender should have to come out for just as long
"On Bouye?

Yeah.  He pushed Cooks out of bounds."
Questionable to return, I havenâ€™t seen anything official but I gotta assume heâ€™s in the protocol
But the refs are in it for the Pats. Didnâ€™t you know?
Probably concussed?
That ball was on the money 
Still questionable to return 
Our players aren't doing the team any favors. Cooks buried that drive
I mean he hit him directly in the hands
That was a PI against Cooks. There's your makeup call, /r/nfl.
Here, I made you this https://imgur.com/gallery/iH5Yy

Christ what an awful play call.
"THE GOATFATHER

Holy fuck I love that man"
I like you. But I sense a wave of down votes for you. 
Dilly Dilly
What the hell is Facebook watch 
"Jets-tier commentary!

Edit: Reddit-tier voting!"
Probably Unfair to say but you can't trade a first round pick for a guy who drops that pass in this game. Absolutely have to have it. Come on dude 
"> Facebook watch 

Because they're watching you "
Still questionable
Thank you!! 
FFS can we stop with the passes behind the line of scrimmage on 3rd down
I am not fond of Tom Brady The Person. 
Agreed but cooks should've caught that
I miss Edelman
DILLY DILLY
Put a Pats flair on if you love em so much
"I care about my family" is bad? this is why people hate football fans lmao
Cooks... You have to make that catch.
They are good at holding, I'll give em that.
In essence the book is a love letter to 80's culture combined with modern sci-fi. Very fun read, but not really much in terms of deeper meaning.
Mad cause Flacco is too ugly for a commercial?
Stay classy. 
Screens havent worked this entire game so why does Josh keep trying them.
Who's drunk?
The hit alone wasn't dirty but when Church started celebrating and taunting then I'm pretty sure it was.
Big if true
We're up to five wide open drops this game. Four of which that would have resulted in 1st downs. 
TBF that first play his left arm was being held by the defender. Hard to make that catch with only one hand
ðŸ
Cooks drop and that that dumb play call killed the drive. Those hb passes near the LOS haven't been working at all.
Oh Cooks, you sorry bastard 
Not yet. I'd be shocked if he came back out considering how long he's been in the locker room. 
Easier to have a sunny disposition if you live in ~~San Diego~~ Los Angeles.
Beat yo ass every tho cuz
Dilly Dilly
still a one score game! Need to get a stop and get a good drive
Exactly why they made the commercial
Can we stop constantly passing behind the line of scrimmage?
Lol so far there have been 3 clear PIs and refs threw the flag 1 time
Hey McDaniels, the short passes aren't working. So let's go ahead and keep calling them. Fuck it
Why don't you roll up and get her? That sucks.
Yes that's my whole point. He was celebrating while Gronk was being helped off the field, after the penalty was announced.
thanks madden
Just crazy how fast they get to the ball carriers 
Well I'd wouldn't have to deal with bad genetics
Pregnant supermodel for another supermodel
They've watched tape, seen the Pat's pull people offsides all year.
Skip Bayless, but Tom is 2nd
Well when Cooks drops TDs yeah.
WTF he is there?!
Thanks Tony
Yeah I feel like they are off
I wish he was just like 20% better than what he is.
First time a player has ever endorsed himself? 
I canâ€™t stand our play calling sometimes
Idk like a shitty youtube red. Which is a shitty Amazon Video. Which is a shitty Netflix. 
K
He playing like Brady Light right now. 
Brady playing lights out but shiiiit drops
I'd go
Tried to watch religion of sports, couldn't get into it

Im not a robot n i love you guys. You have a good D and Fournette (sp) is a BEAST. 
Lol who has a Google pixel, I've never seen one 
That drive ends in a td if cooks catches that
That screen was a killer.
I guess if you donâ€™t watch Silicon Valley he might not be the greatest spokesman according to reddit
You should be thankful for the privilege to watch the GOAT
Including DPI Cooks already has nearly 100 yards for this offense. He's the only one getting open. 
Lol, like two weeks ago. "Bortles is not a top 70 NFL QB". Better than you ever were Chris Simms.
Ah ok well then now youâ€™re just saying your trolling. Also good to know.
We all aren't irrational as you imagine 
They were already broken up when she found out about the baby. Read more and comment less. 
Lol whoops! I meant the center. Like in the Titans game that was reversed to the defense and everyone freaked 
Yeah
This year with Cooks weâ€™ve tried more. Usually we donâ€™t 
Yeah :/
"Someone photoshop Cooks face on a T-Rex for me please.

I love the dude and I'm glad to have him, but man I'd love to see him really layout for the ball when it counts."
Gotta win the battle of field position.
Lol salt
Yes.
"Tom Vs Time: Iâ€™m able to play for so long because my trainer gives me TB12(TM) water, fortified with electrolytes. It allows my body to recover and gives me insane muscle plasticity, on top of a giant penis.

Pats could really use a turnover rn
Skip Bayless maybe
Yeah McDaniels and Patricia can't get the fuck out fast enough. They've both been coasting all season. Fuck off
I prefer Budweiser. Just better imo. 
It wasn't biased. And even so, there have been bad calls both ways this game.
Orwellian tracking and soul sucking addictive interactions. nothing too bad. 
Burr likes the sports,  but has no clue about them. I love his podcasts.  
Brady is making some good throws. Some of these drops have been killer.
That's the Bortles I want to see.
That makes Belichick Illidan, huh?
Vikings.
A good manager for sure... I think he has 2 passes of 10yds+ in the air? Playing just how he needs to to get a W. Moving the ball and not trying to bite off too much. They dont need him to be a superhero.
That's what I think about literally every show on CBS
Itâ€™s supposed to be a light house 
Your mother. 
Cable TV's number one new hit comedy, staring Kevin James 
The latter I believe.
Nice throw 
Middle aged women?
My spinach dip was really low on salt. This thread is really helping.
I feel like there's equal number of people who don't like em.
Hasn't been confirmed out but he is still in the locker room 
"Saying â€œIâ€™m not racist, but...â€ doesnâ€™t mean whatever you say after the but canâ€™t be racist.

Same principle.

I would never wish injury on someone but Iâ€™m not sad he might have a concussion is at best sketchy as fuck."
Ironic, we thought *Tom's* hands would be the problem, not Cooks'.
Jersey # most important part. The fix is in! 
Didn't know she was pregnant when he did, but yes
(Hopefully making the atmosphere just a bit more jovial.)
Nice sack
Sacksachusetts
Lets goooo
I too found the book very underwhelming.  
OOOH some life! 
"Normally I'd disagree, that stuff is the bread and butter of the Pats offense. 

Jags D is too fast for that stuff though, throw it past the line."
Uh oh
Same, he has next year to impress me, if he doesn't then waste of a trade, I wonder if BB talked to Nick before making it tho as I think Nick is a better GM than BB
JFC Patriots need a turnover right now
:(
Second
OMG Trey Flowers just killed Fournette
Fournette got blown up
Yea actually wtf is that about?
Did you see that guy who was in dola's helmet lol. He had to be pulled off
WTF was that TurboTax commercial lmao
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS AD
"That was a swordfish. Marlin Dorsal fins are bigger and a bit thinner.

Marlin also have more vibrant coloring "
man that turbo tax commercial was real fuckin weird huh?
The commercials get weirder every year
It's called getting a little space to punt and not turning the ball over since the likelihood of getting a 1st down there would be pretty slim
No. Worse than Japanese porn.
Youâ€™ve confused me. Flags were thrown. The penalty was dpi. The call was right according to the rule book. For example if the player was pushed out then was not targeted it would be illegal touching. If the player is targeted it is dpi. 2 flags were thrown. The player was targeted. The penalty is dpi. 
How about [now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTqnxRvVMAAcK_9.jpg:large)?
It's their answer to youtube. It doesn't have its own app ... Yet. 
"So, by your brilliant logic, the guy who hit gronk in the head should be targeted? Lmao keep defending this. 

>Yes gronk should be hurt for what he did. He got what he deserved. 

All I need to know everything about you

 fucking lol

"
The hell it doesn't. It means 3 points at least. 
Pats gonna end this game with more sacks then "sacksonvile"
Any more fish facts? 
Yes. The foreplay was good this game.
i agree, but if you earn under a certain amount and/or your taxes are simple, they can be free. 
TIL you can show an impaled man on national television as long as it's for a tax software
He's got a lil notebook in his pocket.  Pencil is for that, not the playsheet
how many times has you counted out Brady again and again only to be proven wrong. This game is a one score game.
No one wears their favorite shirt on a fishing trip. Dead giveaway.
Big if true
Yeah obviously he shouldn't have hit him in the hands
You're winning and your team looks really good. Enjoy it. The game could go either way.
Yeah, we've all seen Good Will Hunting.
Would you say itâ€™s being... deflated?
Still no update on Gronk? Though probably bad sign he's not back yet.
A pass is too risky since a sack means a safety. Running the ball is more likely to give better punting position

that made me laugh too

Government takes 40% of your hard earned money..."at least it was free"
Because it is probably in the top three most iconic soundtracks in cinema. It's like a hockey player wearing number 99. You can (in some leagues) but you'll be shit on, for taking something so iconic.
survivor is still a good show actually
I think the Lions would be rightfully pissed to see their meme co-opted.

So you mean I don't have to pay for the government to refund *my* money?

 when was the last time bortles threw an interception? 
Another screen.
There goes our momentum 
Not playing the victim, playing the guy who's annoyed at all the moron haters 
"/s?

"""Can we destroy all humans?""

""We can do that."" "
STOP THIS CHECKDOWN BULLSHIT BRADY.
For as much as it's been some poor Patriots performances through the game, it's been the Jags forcing that, defensively they've been good.
No forward progression on the first Lewis catch?
I hate mcdaniels
These dump offs to Lewis are not working.  Stop it.
Jags open field tackles are on point
Fake punt pls
This thread is so fucking weird. With half the second half to go people were saying pats were done down 11. Now halfway through the third theyre *down a touchdown* and people are acting like it's all over for the jags. What's up with you people
McDaniels is calling an awful game.
What's he's supposed to do when everyone is blanketed.
CBS is easily the worst cable network. Its like a commercial fest over here
can we stop going for these short game plays. We were doing way better just going for 15 yard passes than these little useless screens. Jags are too fast. 
Even being 40 and not having the arm he once did, he's had 3 perfect 40+ yard throws this game already.
GOFORIT
He also knows how to throw past the first down marker so that would be nice.
Ah yes, unless we have a 20 point lead, we're playing embarrassingly bad
I hate fans like you. 
Deal
Why am I still surprised by how good the Jags D is?
It's the Gillette stadium logo. There's a lighthouse and bridge which you can see in a lot of the aerial shots coming back from commercial and that's what it's of
eeeekkk. man, Jags are fast AF
Why the fuck are the patriots obsessed with these short passes. They havenâ€™t worked all fucking game.
Belichick is getting a hard on with this game turning into all about field position
Have you not read this thread? lol
new england + refs vs the world? i like our odds
Cmon turnover.
Man my stream is behind. I'm getting the "go for it" comments before seeing 1st down.
Nearly time to buy him a [ticket](http://locations.greyhound.com/bus-routes/destination/boston-ma/indianapolis-in#fare-search)
Hahahaha what was that 3 and out
It's not a cable network
If you look at that play, youâ€™ll see Matthew slater behind the returning player. So if they let it go he can pin them at the 1. So itâ€™s better to go for fair catch. 
But all the narratives! The precious narratives! :(
Should your true colors Blake pick 6, you can start ripping cig's on the flight home
uhhh who keeps interrupting my commericals with this football. wtf
IT WOULD BE QUITE UNFORTUNATE IF SOME DEFENSE HAPPENED NOW 
Last drive it was fine. We will adjust and be ok. 
Shitposting on reddit is another option that's worked well for me in the past ;)
the machine keeps pounding
okay I think that Geico commercial was pretty funny
Pats D is showing up, where the fuck is the offense
Damn, they had him back there! 
"I can't wait until mcdaniels is fucking gone.

People will talk about how great of an OC he is, but he does this super lame playcalling and never changes it up even when it's clearly not working."
Fornets spin move is so filthy
"why did bortles stop throwing... 

edit: just kidding!"
Tackle!!!
The 2015 broncos strategy
Except for the last 2 of the first half, they've been money. 
Oh didn't know the game was over
[This is why people assumed he would succeed Darth Hoodie](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/4/4a/Kylo_Ren_TLJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20171223080435)
MORE DEFENSE PLS 
How does his dick taste?
Next possession, maybe we could try not doing a short pass on the third down.
Which illegal shift?
Romo calling it again.
They should listen to Tony
OHH NOO 
He was insane at LSU
Malcolm Butler is dog shit and I won't hear a word in his defence
need to consistently stop them! 
Why do you have Broncos flair?
Crossing routes over the middle have been a killer.
Machetes Lewis
Please tackle Malcolm dont try to knock the ball out for 10 yards
"Holy shit. The jump from a dirty helmet to helmet hit has now taken a turn to rape and murder?

Can I hire you? I have a couple goal posts in my back yard that I have to move across the country. "
I love what Butler did for us but he is a below average corner in coverage these days.
We gotta find a new CB. Butler has only been a liability
To risky with weird bounces
1 =/= 0
Fuck
Malcolm Butler is fucking awful this year. 
That depends. If it goes on long enough then we do.
Our defense is absolutely useless against bunch formations
Thats what we want
How is this predictable playcalling doing this to us 
Pats D laying an egg out there.
It was changed from Throaty Grunt at Ellis Island when his great grandparents came from the old country.
nice nice man
fuuuuu
horrible .
We need an INT. Throw Bortles game off.
Is gronkowski back?
Yeah I was just being a douche lol
"who would win:

-one of the NFL's most sophisticated defensive schemes

-two crossy bois"
Kinda done with Butler tbh 
Butler gets burned so often it's unbelievable 
You canâ€™t let him throw that!
Lol a drag across the middle of the field on 3rd down. That's new
big dick bortles with the trick play
Is gronk able to come back?
Imagine having a shitfit over someone else getting paid, wanting an early extension, and getting burnt on every big 3rd down stop the next year
somehow getting everything god damn
It would be nice to have Gronk back...
I am glad we didnt give him a huge contract.
Short passes and yards after catch are killing them.
Bortles has 4 incompletions. Come on defense...
Jagwires
Yeah I think I'll just kill myself
"Sigh.

Cmon D."
Bortles having an awesome game. Picking us apart
Yes Gillette Stadium sound guy, Damnit is how im feeling right this second.
What actually happened was I disagreed with your premise by pointing out that the penalties genuinely disrupted the game, and you responded by calling me butthurt. But alright.
Obvious crossing situation and they bring up the one guy there to defend it. 
What a mess we are lol 
I felt like they could at least handle the rare but deadly run run pass style of offense 
FUCK CONCUSSION PROTACAL WE WANT GRONK
Tackling is embarrassing
Eh, one series. He's been pretty consistent for every other drive 
The clock is gonna kill us 
Bortles is invicible on 3rd down
Tackling so soft it's not even funny
Every fucking time. Let's take 5 yard to drag the receiver down.
"3rd & 6

McDaniels: Tom, throw it to James White.

Brady: Josh, the last 12 passes have been to one of the RBs.

McDaniels: Exactly, they'll never see it coming."
Well, we had a defense for one series...
Make a fucking tackle 
wtf was that tackle rowe
My feed is so delayed, so forgive me, but dam Romo is the GOAT. He'd be the winningest HC if he got the opportunity!
Bortles went from wanting to rip cigs to ripping the Pats
FUCKING WRAP UP AND TACKLE
Jags are calling a great game man
Nah devils got this 
I hate you Eric Rowe
Nice play by Bortles
Fucking tackle defense why the fuck are you guys such pussies 
Our open field tackling is poor right now
Stop trying to force a fumble and just  tackle.
One play does not a good player make. He was huge in that moment, but he's been a real liability all season
They represent the lighthouse/bridge.
Wait are you happy with the way we've played?
He's Blake freaking Bortles but if guys are 10 yards open he's gonna make the throw! Stop the damn zone
way too reminiscent of the jets game in 2010
This is such a fake game, refs aren't calling anything clearly favoring jax
Tackling is terrible. 
No pressure by the pats
It takea 4 yards to tackle everybody
It's like we're just giving them the 1st down in the middle of the field every play.
Fucking tackle 
Our defense is fucking trash right now. Not sure how Jags can run the same play every single 3rd down and we still haven't figured it out.
"Those are lighthouses/bridges like in the stadium itself (North End).
"
Pats D really struggling to bring people down on first contact. Jags are constantly fighting for and getting extra yardage.
Can the players just fucking wrap up and NOT go for fumbles EVERY FUCKING TIME
"Jags can't have any more point....


OMG the fucking tackling... Jags get 5 yards after first contact every FUCKING time.."
Why the fuck do we always allow the ball carrier to gain an extra 3 yards after contact every single god damn time 
This defense is embarrassing.
First down. First down. First down. Ugh...
Certainly looking like it.
This fucking defense is showing. Two huge drives.
Learn to tackle what the hell 
Should have went for it on 4th down
So the defence showed some life for six plays, and then back to this approach
i'm loving this
Should went on 4th.
Never should have let Ryan walk. He may not be elite but at least he can make a fucking tackle and cover.
What the fuck is this defense?
And flowers is hurt. This game is done
it's just turrible 
Realistically, Jags have completely controlled this game.
The defence might have remembered that they suck again
Jags appear noticeably younger, faster, and stronger
Our defense is drunk 
Ok. So it is a matter of 3 yards? Total bs call. 
God Rowe was trying to hard to punch the ball out, he didn't just try to take him down
"Jags score here, I am going to start getting worried.

Ok, I lie. I already am."
Saw that. Fucking Rowe
I think if we had hightower it would do pretty well
Idk why we're down 7 lol
Doesn't make sense. If Brady is a Demon Hunter, his leader would be Illidan. Not the bad guy DHs are fighting against. Unless you buy into the E!SPN narrative, that is. 
I think this is a loss unless something significant changes. Just can't get stops.
They played Finch not that long ago too.
Hope you lions fans are all very excited for a full season of this without the offence to save you
"I smell an interception
"
If we don't win this the Jaguars better win the Super Bowl or I'm gonna be very upset
It's over, defense is totally gassed out
Fucking Rowe has been playing like crap 
The pats don't have Edelman or gronk...
Truth, it's painful to watch.
Maybe not a bad thing Patricia is leaving.
Lions you can take Patricia right now pls
28-3
Nah, just a bunch of white people. I've heard Hall and Oates before.
Pats just have no answers
Seeing what dollar stores are in Detroit 
NE D is hitting them too high. They're not getting the leverage and the Jaguars are getting a lot of yards after contact.
Church taunted and celebrated after the hit. That was dirty.
If jags score TD, man...
You think we will score 3tds that fast? thanks
I can't believe how horrid the defense has been
that is an insult to ass, my dude
So about time for a Brady 4th quarter comeback?
No not Flowers
It's 100% a good thing 
Hold them to a field goal. Iâ€™m still confident we got this 
r/Patriots are losing their shit rn.
Right... So you judged admitted that he extended his arm and barred him from getting back in? 
Imagine if we had either of our best receivers and half our defence...
I'm not blaming him. I would be blaming cooks for a dropped pass
Pats trailed by 19 at the start of the 4th versus Atlanta. Plenty of time left in this one.
Gronk isn't either but apparently one dirty hit is enough to get the label
They don't lack talent though. They do, however, look completely confused
Players have to execute too.
Jags are just a better team to be honest, we need another Brady miracle to win this. 
Lights out. Gong. Can it be? It is! It's Gronk!
Joey aged well 
He doesn't get to play our trash defense.
Jags have almost 29 minutes of possession after 45 minutes of play, they are gassed beyond belief. 
The Patriots are taking a page out of the Andy Reid Playbook on Clock Management today. The TOP is killing us
LET'S GOOOO!!
I think your nose is broken 
15 minutes is a lot of time. 
this game is FAST. just how good football should be!
To quick...
yeap all these small trick plays and extra yards jags are getting, patriots will get fcked
Lol no.
he's playing out of his mind.
I remember. 
Lots of time.  Not worried.  
Matt Patricia is already coaching the Lions
I have no idea what point you are trying to make, whether you are serious or joking.
Looks like it.
"What's a computer?" ad sighting here in the UK. Nowhere is safe!
Wondering what route they will attack Rowe with on this third and long?
...I suspect you don't actually know what those words mean
Kevin Can Wait and Man With A Plan look wretched.  Does anyone still watch CBS' crap-o-rama?
Why is the D playing like shit? That awesome offensive  play calling to go 3 and out put the Defense on the field with no rest has nothing to do with it. Good luck with mcdaniels indy
Damn could be the game to launch Bortles into the psuedo-elite tier like Eli?
They already got Giancarlo.
"Time of possession through three quarters:

Jaguars - 29.07
Patriots - 15:53


not ideal"
Pats D is saying you can't win unless Bortles can make throws.. but then they're giving Bortles throws a PeeWee could make. No one anywhere near receivers
We need this game to slow down. I feel sick right now. 
It's kind of rare to see a team play well with a lead against New England. A lot of teams end up beating themselves; JAX not fucking around.
God damn dude the Coughlin Curse is a real thing. BB can't beat that old fucker. He's like the Darth Sidious to our Darth Vader. 
The only reason I still have hope is I remember what happened in the super bowl. 
The fact you've even seen it raises a lot of concern 
Because of a certain RB that will skull drag them down the field lol. 
do you mean something political? i feel like if gaga didn't last year, pink probably won't, especially during the anthem. 
probably a few will blame it on that, but gronk doesn't play defense. we can't even get the offense on the field.
No word yet, so you're probably right
Lmao I'm so happy they're leaving. We've been winning despite them since 2015
Right, but they put up 45 against yours...
Yeah, Gronk wants to know too.
You mean you haven't started yet?  You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning.
It's a 2-score lead. That's a huge deal.
The NFL is dark and full of commercials
Well It certainly doesnt appear that he is coordinating a defense so maybe
No, because you're a Giants fan.
Fucking third down performance is atrocious on both sides of the ball
God I hope so
ðŸ¤”
Without Gronk tho?
The North Remember!
25, really.
Hold them to the fg here and you're still in it, though you're getting to the point where it's uncomfortable. You'll probably need the D to make 2 quick stops.
that's the jag's gameplan. Limit the amount of possessions, it's working perfectly
Yeah that's not how links work
but will we ever found out what a computer is?
How come the airport security guard doesnâ€™t care about all of the other cars that are parked on the curb?
He's making the Pats D look soft. That dude wants a Super Bowl more I think. 
I think he was referring to the Malkovich promo
and the comebacks all before that as well. Shite perfomance so far though
Defense ia gassed because offense goes no huddle for a 3 and out tp open the half and put them on the field twice as fast
It's not even a smooth gradient either. It's so abrupt. Like someone just learned how to use the Photoshop gradient layer style for the first time.
Nice try 
I was promised Bortles was a garbage QB. 
Dude, fuck you. If the Jags win, they earned it.
Josies on vacation far away
LBs and Rowe need to step up on this down.
"Oh it's close. There has been no life from the Pats offense and the defense has had some good stops to help out the offense only for the offense to choke it away.

Unless the Pats get fired up on that sideline it's not looking good."
Is it a good or a bad thing that I've felt like this many times in the past?
Defense cant keep up with the Jags unfortunately. Not game over but not optimistic.
Well considering the jaguars have the best defence in the league... I don't see your point
It's my darkest secret 
The fans 
!remindme
I'm not worried about Brady.
defense? 
Only 11 months till Christmas!   
A couple of seasons ago a team won the superbowl with a pretty average qb
Safe play there to keep in FG range.
Yeah a regular season loss to the Orlando Magic will be immortal.
I don't think you saw return of the Jedi
Ok, we can deal with 10 points... if our D steps up.
Abortles
Wide left
Most of our fans only tune in for the AFCCG and Super Bowl and don't actually know shit about football. 
[Gronk is out](https://twitter.com/Patriots/status/955202014534914048)
YES
"The pats aren't tackling....or are, but are getting pushed back 4 after contact. 

and brady doesn't have  gronk...

"
Not a huge waver of his flag, no. His first half defenses are usually lackluster 
Good throw away
Shank it!
Heâ€™s not the best db.
Bortles, right now. Shredding us
"But Darth Vader killed Darth Sidious.

Edit:  Looks like you were right, Vader killed Sidious"
Damn, Lambo.
Patriots fan, can confirm
That looked like it'd have been good from 65 
Lambo split the Dilly Dillys
Good kicking!
Gronk ruled out. Tough loss.
Has Lambo been this accurate all year? Kid looks real good.
Iâ€™m not worried 
You'll appreciate it with Jimmy soon enough 
I'd have thought a Packers fan gets enough stupid complaining about the refs to know better than this.
You mean JJ Watt will be named the winner
Gronk OUT. Down 10, game probably over unless some Minnesota shit happens.
How does watt not win that?
Ya, if ya could stop with the perfect kicks...
Okay. No more screens this time. 
Lambo is on the top of my draft board for next year's fantasy football.
Can the offense please sustain a drive here?
Okay but that drop was massive and right in his hands 
Come on Pats, I believe.
Should have gone for it during the 4th and twos.
Watt is winning for sure.
Jags, your defense is legit. 
COOOOOOUGHLIIIIIIIIIN!!!!
JJ Watt looks pissed off
huge mistake
Yeah, I thought he got hit back.  My bad
That guy cuts it right down the middle evertim
Bennett not man of the year?  Color me shocked!
He is out. :-/
Lambo MVP
But all of the people saying it wasn't a penalty disagree.
JJ I think is a lock. 
Maybe if he had autism, and wasn't clear on figurative language.
Honestly they didn't need to move the ball. They know the Pats cant score and a FG makes it a 2 score game
Loss of Gronk may have decided the game unfortunately. 
If it aint broke...
I didn't realize he jumped back.  I thought he was hit first.  My bad
Cheapshot piece of shit
? Bortles has hardly been touched today.
Sad to hear Gronk is out, but I'm glad they did what they're supposed to.
Good job on pats for not just rolling gronk back out there
Fuck. gronk. RIP IN PEACE 
Damn... Gronk being out is an awful blow.
He seems a little overhyped today but he's still better than the others.
God dam you church 
The fact that there is no punishment for Church shows the NFL doesn't give a shit about concussions
FUCK
"Gronk knocked out by a dirty ass play, 15 yard penalty for it..
Bullshit"
That hit, jesus
Jax traded a TD to take out the best TE in the league right now. Unfair trade
WOW did not expect gronkowski to be out. 
As an Aggie, it's so good to see Josh Lambo killing it.
GRONK out goddam 
Gronk out-Dirty ass Jacksonville can't beat us straight up. 
Pats jumbotron saying Dilly Dilly during the kick! The cancer has spread!
The fact that the jags can eliminate gronk for a 15 yard penalty is ludicrous. 
Oh boy, Gronk is out. 
just got the notification from ESPN, looks like gronk's going from questionable to out. It's only 10 points, we can still do this!
Way to go JAX, dirty plays get you dirty wins.
Patriots score here, Jax gets ball, takes up the clock, kicks a FG, Brady 2 minute drills to win by 1. Its all scripted folks.
Im not optimistic about this 
"People cheering for injuries.

Disgusting."
This is Lambo's Field
"Gronk is out for the game, GG.

Church celebrating after knocking him out with a shitty hit was by far my favorite part of this game"
Yes, let's run it for 2 yards. Good strategy.
Knocking Gronk out of the game with a cheap shot may be a winning strategy for teams playing against the Patriots.
Time to stop running the ball like start of the half
Yeah
"The Jags are playing like they've been here before...amazing stuff, honestly 

#FUCK"
Still got 3
Yeah, and it's bullshit
That was the right call. Congrats to the NFL for finally fulfilling their promises.
What a boring game.
Explain how that's karma? 
"NFL really needs NCAA rules for helmet to helmet shit.

edit: LOL, downvotes for suggesting headhunters get ejected just because I've got Pats flair."
Targeting needs to be an automatic ejection. Dirty team. 
\#1 way to guard Gronk: injure him so he comes out
COOKIE
Iâ€™m very nervous
Brady hurt, dirty play knocks out gronk, best receiver out... not excuses they are reasons
Fuck the head hunting pos Jags.. Brady gonna destroy them even w/o Gronk
Rooting for a concussion is crass as hell.
As a Pats fan, I just want to say that I did not like that hit at all, and was dissapointed in him for doing that. I know I'm only one fan but dirty hits should never be celebrated. 
Glad they didn't decide like other teams to violate concussion cues to try to win a game, as Gronk's long term life is so much more important than a football game. 
Truth
Donâ€™t ever count out the GOAT
"Gronk? he was suspended though
"
Apparently that's how you stop Gronk, dirty head shot and only lose 15 yards
Brady is going to need to go Super Saiyan if he wants to convert. Gronk is out now thx to Church 
Just get rid of everyone outside of Bill, Brady, Gronk, Dion, White, Dola, and Edelman. Coaching staff included. Blow it up and start with a clean slate.
Welp, tough task asking to win without Edelman, Hightower, Gronkowski, and Brady's right hand. Those players carry the team so much.
Best gameplan vs gronk: cheapshot
"It goes back to missed catches (like cooks) and not forcing missed tackles.

"
Did they photoshop the JJ Watt photo?
He's out for the game
Romo is a great hype man
Personal foul with helmet contact that causes concussion should take the offender out of the game. Jags got a big break by taking a penalty. I know this will be down voted but whatever. 
WHAT!!?
OMFG OMFG
Yeah they just went and did it himself 
Gg
Lol wtf
What did the Bills do to deserve not making the playoffs all those years?
"*** ATTENTION ***

If the New England Patriots complete this comeback, I will officially change my flair to the New England Patriots for the Super Bowl."
what the fuck just happened
Well now that Gronk is officially out everybody better fucking step up
Lmao
Are you for fucking real
He was down......
DAMN.
I don't know, I can see it going the way it has been since he went out :(
Double pass to fumble??
HEâ€™S DOWN
Not even a TD. Just 15 yards.
I'd call that a fumble.
uyterewruky8i6sfdgerygdfxcdert5w46eyw5t43q2
That was a great trick play too.
If Jags win this they'll be my favorites for the SB. This defense is insane.
Oh Lord 
Oh he was down 
Tony is Brady af
I hope I hope I HOOOOPE he has it.
NOOOOOO!
whew almost made it all the way though a game without mentioning 28-3
Damn, such a great playcall, better play by Jack.
He looks down
His knees hit the ground
OOOOOOOOOOO OHHHHH EHHHHH
Not a fumble, not even fucking close. 
Well that was certainly more aggressive.... but not the result we wanted at all.
DOWN
Well everything about that play was unexpected lol
Barry Church is the new Bernard Pollard
Fuck!
What a fucking rollercoaster 
He's got control of the ball when he goes down
Lewis why the hell did you slow down?
It was pinned when he hit the ground
OH MY FUCKING GOD
Well this shouldn't be controversial either way
Lmao well fuck gg
Not at all
Yes it's bad. You sound like a shitty person.
Trapped
Holy shit Jack, that looked like a clean pickpocket live
Yeesh...
That stands. 
Damn that is close
Run Lewis, why are you walking so slowly, just run!!! Holy this team is playing bad.
Ball came loose but maybe it was pinned against his leg again.  
Romoâ€™s fucking annoying as shit today
wtf is he doing???? why didn't he just run.
No question it's a fumble
DOWN AS FUCK
Clearly in control on the ground. Presses the ball against his leg.
Gonna lose game to a dirty hit. Have fun getting blown out by the Vikings jags. 
I thought the Jags got the ball at first, but after watching it in slow motion it looks like he was down
Ball moved but he never lost possession 
looks like a New England TD to me
That's gonna stand 
Looked to he pinned against his side.
Don't give it back to us. We'll never hear the end of it.
I think he regained possession but Iâ€™m not sure feelsbad
Wow Lewis.. 
HEâ€™S DOWN
If these refs like NE heâ€™s down by contact
3 blockers in front of him and he drifts to the right with no one. That's not a fumble tho, he got control back and was down
I don't envy the refs reviewing this shit lmao
Without Gronk this the same team that was humiliated by Miami
Welp that's it
All I know is if this is reversed the NFL is rigged.
Ball secured on hip,  knee down,  np fumble. 
There's no reason for this to be overturned
this is a fumble and Jags ball
If they overturn I will agree this is rigged
Down by contact pinned to his body
he's got it pinned but no way they overturn this. god fucking dammit
Fuck
He held it on his thigh wtf
WHAT
Behind the line of scrimmage
"God fucking damn it
"
He had the ball pinned to his side when he hit the ground
No fumble 
"Down!
What the fuck"
Has it pinned against his hip when he hits the ground
I work for Apple and can tell you we donâ€™t have commercials. Other companies have commercials with out products in them.
I don't really give a fuck as long as they get the call right.
That's gotta be down. It was pinned on his hip
He presses the ball against his leg and is down. That is not a fumble.
"cut my life into pieces

ball stripped by forty four

did the trick pass

lost the ball

dont win the game if we cannot ourscore"
It's out.
I wanna die
If you can have possession by pinning the ball against your helmet or your shoulder, why would this be different? 
Welp...
"OooOOooh! Uhh..."
Your QB is casting the game..
Yeah I don't see how they could overturn it. Nice fuckin play by Jack! 
Damn
kill me 
Fuck
he was suspended a game
He's down.
Jags ball, anything else is a travisity 
Holy shit wtf.
Bullshit. He got control back and was down
Yeah, I think it needs to stay with the ruling. If it had been called down it'd be the same. It definitely looks like he clamps it back down, but not enough to overturn.
Fuck you Dion...
That's a fumble 
"bullshit trick play" ? you make it sound like its something bad that only the pats do? Delusion much
Call of the game boys.
Wow... what a sequence
Yea. I think whichever that was called on field would stand. 
It's either gonna be "everybody hates the Pats" or "the refs are giving them the game
"Clearly secured against his side.  


lol.  Salty kids here. "
Right call. =(
Hey, at least the conspiracy theories are now dead in the water.
Fuck.
It's the right call - no way you can say that's back in control there.
Ref giving jags the game.
See if the refs were really in our pocket we woulda got that call overturned
if he didn't stutter step and move back to the inside, he wouldn't have been hit like that. 
Why was the clock running after cook walked out of bounds?
What in the world was Lewis doing? 
well shit
RIP haha
His knee was down while the ball was on his hip in his possession. 
Welp jags are clearly a good team win or lose.
Sucks, but the right call.
Damn, whereâ€™s this ref bias you all claim we get? Could really use it right now :/
Everyone here said the refs were on our side?
It wasnt moving anymore when his elbow hit, but whatever.
"BULLSHIT!!!! HE HAD BALL PINNED TO HIS BODY AND WENT LOSE AFTER HE WAS ON GROUND..


BULLSHIT"
Embarrassing loss. Wasted year. Fuck my life
great play too. defense wins championships 
Bull shit 
Three blockers? Letâ€™s not block the one linebacker closest to dion....
Death.
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cj9Q6D1UYAAaFGe.jpg
Oh thatâ€™s bullshit, his knee was down 
Jags gonna take like 5 Mins off the clock here 
I think he's down tbh.
They're going to announce it and everything?
Can we afford to bench Dion with Gronk out? 
"HURR DURR REFS LOVE THE PATRIOTS.


Go fuck yourselves braindead idiots who think we get favourable calls. "
"Not a fumble
"
I can't argue with that call, but... fuck.
That's the right call tbh 
The majority of the comments are saying it was the right call...
Dirty fucking cats. 
nfl is rigged right guys?
I thought the Patriots had paid all the refs ðŸ¤”
FUCK YOU LEWIS!!!!
Smell test says fumble.
That was a legit fumble man
Because they stopped where he went down the ball was recovered.
That's literally all this thread was from non-pats fans in the second quarter...
Why did they blow the play dead if the initial ruling was a fumble?
That wasn't a fumble it was pickpocketing
Oh yeah the pats paid the refs sure
White > Lewis
What's the rule when the player has the ball trapped?   
Dude.  That was a fumble.
But the refs who love the Pats!? Why would they do that to us? 
Shhh that doesn't fit the narrative 
Feel terrible for Lewis, he was our 3rd most important offensive player this season (Behind Brady and Gronk) and his biggest mistake comes in the most important game.
Not really. It was a fumble that Dion regained control of, but you need to maintain control through the ground to gain possession. If it wasn't knocked loose it would have been down by contact, but since Lewis had to regain possession it's a clear fumble.
Thought we had Riveron in our pocket ðŸ™„ 
Yeah, that was an unambiguous fumble. Sucks that it came at the end of such a well executed aggressive play.
How do you have 3 lead blocks and then get caught from behind and fumble? Why was the ball on his inside arm? This is amateur shit
That's a good call
Most of the players weren't attempting to stop the guy since a whistle had already been blown
Nope. 
So just a piece of shit fan in general. Got it. 
Iirc he needs to survive the ground because he's going to the ground as he recovers. It's the same "control" issue as when NE got a break on the touchback play in the regular season.
No idea
Ok. 
Dunno, but the actor has his own show on nbc
gg Jags. Looks like a franchise that has never won a SB will win it. (MIN/PHI/JAX)
Most definitely. They deserve it. 
I can't believe I'm saying it. I'm glad they didn't give it back to white. 
Looked like he was in real time. Obviously not after review.
Correct call, wild play
God damnit Lewis! You could see he wasn't ready to get hit. I knew he'd fumble just by the way he was holding the ball. We're seriously gonna lose this game. Just wow. Good freaking run Jags
hurrr rigged game hurrr durrrr
It's ok, we can let you other guys get a chance at a Super Bowl too. Seems like you guys need it in your lives.
That only happens when the opposing team has any penalty.  Otherwise the refs do a spectacular job.  
Because he wouldâ€™ve been down by contact
Thats not a fumble
I take my last comment back, that was the right call
These refs are bullshit jags get all the calls amirite nfl 
He might have but no way you can tell for sure.
Correct call. Nothing makes me more upset than a lack of ball security
"Trying to stay behind his blockers. He's a developed a really patient running style this year where he'll slow down to let gaps open and develop.

The Bell style."
Because it was recovered by a player who was in contact with Lewis, so he was down?
Is what it is time to move on
Shitty situational running from Lewis. Had 3 blockers and cut away from them towards the middle.
But the refs are on our side, I don't get it.
I think he was down by Lewis 
I dont think he ever saw him coming from behind
Typical boys in blue. The fix is in. PaTs GeT EvErY CaLl. \#rigged
He was down by contact
You may need to done with football anyways 
Damn,  that was a gorgeous play until that point too.  Well played Jags.  There's still time though.
O rly?
"That was Dion Lewis's first fumble this whole season.

Fucking hell."
Well, we had a good run, boys! Good game Jags, will probably be rooting for you in the Super Bowl
i canâ€™t believe how bad we are playing 
Excuse me I was informed that this game was rigged.
HUGE FUCKING STOP
He was down with the ball. They were both lying on each other.
Guys the tallest Mofo out there, you don't accididently hit him in the head 
Got the stop there at least. Lets go boys.
HUGE stop.
He was down by contact man, Lewis was on his side...
Uncatchable 
We got lucky that we stopped them 
Huge drops, no Gronk, huge fumble, terrible play calling for most of the game. Practically everyone but Brady is playing very poorly.
still got time! 
He was contacting Lewis so he was down by contact.
Sucks but that was the right call.
Lmao jags offense feeling the dick against the back of their throat
What a clutch tackle
OPI
Good stop. They're punting
I don't understand why Lewis ran to the right when he had 3 pats on the left clearing the way for him.
Good job D.
A Jaguars - Eagles Super Bowl would be painfully dull
How did Tony know that butler was blitzing? Dude is psychic
What an absolutely brilliant defensive play. Hats off
He was down when he recovered the fumble.
I thought the game was supposed to be rigged by the refs in the Patriots favor?
I agree with you but it's super close
Probably, I think if they called no fumble it stands anyways.
DAMMIT TONY DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT 
Lol shut the fuck up
He's an NFL QB
Youâ€™re pathetic 
Sneak skill 100 on that shit
Weird that was called against us since according to this thread the refs are trying to give us the game. wow very strange.
Great stuff by D. Still time to go down and score but we've got to have something on this drive.
Alright letâ€™s get a score 
This is a good game. Jags D is ridiculous, and DAMN if that offensive gameplan wasn't smart as hell.
0-16
GREAT STOP!!!
Still 12 minutes left and only down 10.  Fans like you are pathetic.
Our money wasn't enough to overturn the call just enough to stop the play dead I guess.
Butler was leaning towards the quarterback in a sprinting stance kind of way, his shoulders werenâ€™t square to the receiver 
#Phew 
That happens all the time though
Not sure wtf he was thinking
This game is far from over.
You daft? he regain possession.
Lol
He's right almost every time he predicts a play. 
You mean did he have the ball pinned to his body when he contacted the ground?  Yes he did
Wait if you are talking about the fumble recovery he was down anywas.. had a player almost laying on him 
Still a penalty 
Probably blown dead by a ref who thought he, was down by contact until they had the conference. 
It was loose and he didnâ€™t regain definite possession.  As much as I hate that he fumbled...it should be a fumble from my view
He did. But thats fine. I dont want r/nfl exploding xause a questionable call went the pats way
Belichick finds your lack of faith... disturbing
Definitely the best NFL announcer there is.
Waaah!!!! It's rigged!  Waaah!!!!!
agree
decades as the most important player on the field. He knows his stuff
The ball also never stopped moving. It was a fumble.
But it will make Cleveland a costal city which they don't deserve. 
Either watch more football or educate yourself before getting all butthurt. The Jacksonville player was down on the ground with possession and was touched. He is down by contact at the spot he takes over possession from the Patriots runner and can no longer advance the ball. 
Cooks dropped a TD lol.
"He got hit from behind unexpectedly. 

Great play by Jack, not a fuck-up by Lewis."
Gronk was standing tall, he got concussed because church head hunted
Everyone hates the Pats? Yeah it's every week lol 
sober, please
How about some more 3 yard runs and screen passes! That should work now!
Most of the offense weren't attempting to stop him because the refs had already blown a whistle. Without the confusion, it's a guaranteed stop.
I hope you're right 
Down by contact. He was on the ground touching lewis
I feel a comeback man, this game is ours!
That is what was running through my mind during all those replays. He had a clear path to the left behind three blockers.
Yes he was. They fucking showed him celebrating
Ignoring the fumble, that play was fucking dope as hell. When I saw the first pass went backward to Amendola I thought he was gonna throw it downfield, but a second lateral all the way across? That shit was bananas.
Of fucking course after we finally get a couple decent plays Lewis kills the momentum with a fumble. FML.
Atleast they didnt score any points off that
Itâ€™s like seeing a ghost man
Seriously. Fucked up big time.
Helmet to helmet is always a flag.  What's your actual question?
I think it could of gone either way and been justifed either way.  Im not mad about the call. 
Who else's pants are full of poop?
I think they blew it because he was down by contact as soon as he recovered.
Fans of sports teams gettig over emotional is nothing surprising. Why would it start now?
Two minutes off the clock and 50 yards of field position
I'd love for Brady to go out on top this year, but I can't be mad at a loss to a defense this good. 
Td or fg here or this games over
They have been letting a lot of stuff go on both sides.
Fumble stands? But I thought this was a Pats REF SHOW??????
He was in contact with the RB when he was down.
He was contacted. 
Rip 6
Well he spiked it soooo
Patriots win!
nobody will care cause it went against the Pats
Not from me.  This is a hard fought game of attrition.  
On their own 39?
Suck it bro
It's almost like every fanbase in the history of sports boos calls against their team. Crazy, I know.
He was making contact with Dion, he was down. Just like Dion with control of the call still
I dunno, there's still time for Jonathan Kraft to bring his team back into this! Oh, wait, executive VPs aren't the coaches? Hmm. 
mine lol
He was laying on the ground with the ball and Dion was touching him.  He was down.
UCF is a joke now 
So isn't Lewis.
Happens every week
Waaah!! It's the refs!!!  Waaah!!!
Refs are inept.
We're still here bud. 
Do people not understand when he picked up the fumble he was touching Lewis. Down by contact. He couldn't run it for a TD.
that made me laugh... come on romo. i love him but that was stupid. 
Not dirty necessarily. I think he led with the shoulder and Gronk just being larger caused heads to collide. Unfortunate, not dirty, but head to head is a penalty regardless of intent. Doubt he sees any punishment though, just unfortunate circumstances
Still not confident in the O's ability to get this done without gronk.
Super risky given their field position
I still don't think that was a fumble 
He never reestablished possession while going to the ground after a fumble 
Should've kept running. Last thing you want to do is give us a chance. ðŸ˜ˆ
I was told this game was biased against the Jags
it's risky. If they don't get it they turn over the ball. Better to send new england deep into their own zone
If Bradys receivers could catch theyd be in the lead
I need a drink
What sucks the most is that the fumble play was brilliant. If 1 guy had picked up that side/back pressure that cause the fumble it could have been close to a td with all the blockers.
Credit to Jags D, but wow they are cocky. But they're destroying the Pats so, yea
Down by contact as he gained possession.    
They didn't blow it early he was contacted when he gained control. And he was on the ground. How people don't see that is baffling.
Yeah. I was confused why he was running so slow behind them. 
That wasn't a fumble 
Watching at full speed, that's a tough no-whistle to make, especially if you have a bad angle on the tackle.
Itd be a comeback wouldnt say legendary
How many 2 minute drills can TB12 fit into 13 minutes 
Just to weird you out.  Pats fan here.  I thought it was.  
"I think he was down by contact. They were all over eachother.
"
Yeah it's fixed, yet they still gave the Jags the ball. This sub has gone insane from Pats hate.
Brady's been fine. Receivers have been dropping more than Brady has been missing.
He 100% had control. It's just that gaining possession requires surviving the ground. It's a fumble due to the "catch rule".
Yes
Since it basically changed possession while they were wrapped up he was down by contact
Are you gonna reply to me substantially? Or are you too dumb to have to be relegated to ad hominem attacks?
i mean... edelman's been out all year too so its kinda even there buddy
I saw that as well; it was a great play before Lewis tried to show off his moves. I mean he had three blockers literally clearing a path to end zone.
Are you sure weâ€™re not just paying the refs off? Iâ€™m not too sure.
There was contact between them though during the fumble and he rolled to the ground so play is dead. No?
Yeah, it was those dorty refs, SEEEEEEE? NYAH!
Would have been down where he stole ball since they were touching each other
Saved us? They blew the whistle because Lewis was fucking down with the ball pinned against his leg, then they switched it to fumble. 
[I'm salty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0)
Hey man there's still 12 mins left and our D is looking stronger than it has all game.  Trust in New England my friend.
It looked pinned, but I don't think that's enough "control"? I don't hate that call. I mean I do, but not the ruling.
And risk giving a short field? Nah you trust your defense.
I am, but this defense can't stop shit.
They probably thought when he grabbed control he was touching Dion.
Patented BB/TB12 comeback incoming 
That wasn't a fumble. Lewis held the ball all the way to the ground.
No
Needless risk when your defense is as good as theirs.
We're also missing our top WR fyi...
This would all hurt less if memes weren't a thing
To be fair, Losing someone in the middle of a game and having an entire season to adjust your offense are very different situations
With this winter we need plenty of salt for the roads. 
Agreed but not enough to overturn the initial call...
You can bet BB is going to give him a hell of a talk
Not the first time thatâ€™s happened, wonâ€™t be the last 
Considering the Pats rely on the pass game a lot more than the Jags, Gronk is much more important than ARob and if you think otherwise you're actually delusional.
Because I think he was still in contact with Lewis and on his back when he established possession, which would make him down by contact.
Yeah the Pats have their top receiver too. Edelman has had a hell of a year. 
Cooks on that same route has been killing them
Piss off
Cooks is on fire
Getting a lot of value from Cooks on the comebacks
FINALLY Cooksie goes up and fights for one!
Shouldn't even have been a fumble, he got control back and was down then the ball came out. Luckily we got the ball back tho so bad call doesn't matter much
yep
I fucking despise the playoff picture commercial 
Lmao, this gold post this on the post game thread
Finally Cooks!
thank you Cooks!
He was a lot better earlier in the season IMO. He was a lot more analytical, now he has become more fanboy than anything.
Why is everyone saying jags should have gotten a TD on that fumble? He was clearly down by contact. 
He was touching the NE player when down with possession.
Pats win by 3 
Lol
Pls donâ€™t fuck up pls donâ€™t fuck up pls donâ€™t fuck upâ€¦
Down by contact when he touched Lewis to grab the ball
No doubt. Iâ€™ve been proven wrong before so Iâ€™m not giving up.
No.
*woosh*
Third string right tackle
Brady sacked by...Brady?
Depends on if TB12 becomes Patriot of the week
No, because he was down by contact.
Because we are the bad guys remember
*woosh*
Not saying we were screwed. Just annoyed as fuck at everyone saying the refs are favoring us.
Too bad hes blatantly rooting for the jags, I liked him this year
Course not, but these idiots can't decide what possession means. They change the rules every play of every game.
It's the same control rule that's helped the Patriots this year, specifically the time where the got a touchback from a fumble. Because he's going to the ground when recovering the ball he has to survive the ground.
This thread is moving too quick for me to see nearly all the comments, but I didn't see any pats fans bitching about that fumble call (because it was the right call). I hope that's the case, this game has been reffed well so far, and if the Jags win it is because they are playing better. But if the Pats win I don't want to have to hear from people about the damn refs any more than everyone else wants to hear from pats fans about them.
Damn this is where Gronk would be great
"Pats refs smiling after pats get a TD at end of the 1st half. Bad cellphone shots of tv sorry in advance.

That was a dumb throw 
[Yes](https://pics.me.me/peoplein-thesixties-better-not-say-that-or-the-governmentwill-wiretap-24983486.png)
Lewis lost possession before he waa down.
Can we stop going for these deep balls the Jags D isn't stupid they're not going to fall for it. 
2nd and long deep throws are my least favorite and we do it like 50% of the time
"I just trusted a fart that I shouldn't have. 

"
Do these Patriot Desperation Deep Balls ever work
Why even throw that? 
what are we doing... we can't just throw it deep on low probability plays and hope the Jags give us penalty yards
need a score here!
"â€œThree blockers down the sideline? Let me run towards middle of the field where the defenders are.â€

Fucking idiot Dion. Couldâ€™ve just ridden the blockers asses till heâ€™s pushed out of bounds. One fucking job, hold onto the ball. What a fucking asshole."
I got some yeses
DOLA!
"The eagles are going to swoop in and fly them to the endzone.

... Not the team, but Tolkien's eagles."
Oh, OK. Just as long as the refs are still in the Pats' pocket. Gotta make sure we're getting our money's worth.
Cooks is playing amazing so far
Big dick dola!!
DANNY
The Dola!!
Rarely takes shots though. Part of the reason he's lasted so long
Of course 'dola comes up clutch on 3rd and 18!
AMEN
DOLA!
Danny "third down" Amendola
Danny clutchendola
Dola is C l u t c h
Hows the dick taste
Blake Bortles is going to start a super bowl isn't he
How many 3rd and longs has Dola converted this season? Feels like 10. 
Holy shit yes! Dolllaaaa!
Great catch!
"Call Helps the Pats: ""LOL Sum bullshit this is the WWE Now""

Call Goes Against the Pats: ""LOL Shut up pats fans that was the right call"""
3rd down Dola! 
You are right.
C l u t c h m e n d o l a
Dorsett!!! 
Wow!
That's a flea flicker
The British actually has helicopters in 1775, we just got Revere's message wrong.
GOAT doing GOAT things.
HOLY SHIT! WE HAVE A DORSETT SIGHTING!
Danny boy!!!
Ok sorry.
See Bortles, when you run the flea flicker you throw deep down field after.
DORSETT?! 
O bby
PLAYOFF DOLA
lol Belichick is in don't give a fuck mode right now. 
That's the catch dorsett makes this year
Momentum shift?
The GOAT is GOATing.
My heart is ready for an attack every trick play 
Fleaflicker!
DORSETT
"OK, fandom aside, can we all take some joy in two flea-flickers in one game? 

That shit makes me smile."
Yes. The refs meet up at night the game before. Collude and drink scotch on how they will fix the game ðŸ™„
Two flea flickers in one game. Kinda cool.
Those plays are the reason the Pats still pay Dola. He's clutch.
Thank goodness for Amendola. I don't trust Cooks right now.
DO YOU FUCKING BELIEVE IN MIRACLES??? 
That's your one catch Dorset go sit back down
Dorsett out of ALL people.
Fuckin goat and u know it
1st round draft pick baby
So you want them to also call the jags holding?
I forgot Dorsett was on our team lol
Nice catch by dorsette ( I love the flea flicker)
WOW HUGE PLAY!!
"He fumbled the ball. The ""catch rule"" is the rule for gaining possession. After that first fumble he regains control but it's now a ""gaining possession"" situation with him going to the ground. Since he loses the ball on contact with the ground the ""catch rule"" says he didn't regain possession after the initial fumble and therefore the ball is still live instead of being ruled down by contact.

I understand that the catch was completed, it's just that the ""catch rule"" isn't exclusive to catches; it's the rule for how players gain possession. It is most commonly applied for catching a ball from the air, but follows the exact same rules for recovering a fumble."
FUCKING HELL YEAH I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE
Holy offensive pass interference right in front of the ref
See what happens when you actually throw a reasonable distance? Why are we throwing everything 50+ yards or in front of the sticks?
"""I guess I'm throwing to Dorsette""
-Tom Brady"
If contacting  Lewis resulted in him going to ground.  He is down by contact.
\#JustGOATthings
Funny coming from a packers fan
neat.
This feels like a Drake Hotline Bling meme
THE DICK IS HARD AND TASTES BAD
That would look really cool
NICE!!
I don't like how slowly NE is moving. Killing the clock and letting Jacksonville get comfortable.
Dola's on fire.
Lol people complaining about holding as if every play at every level of football doesn't have holding
You know, they can only take that deep shot on 2nd and 18 because they feel comfortable in their ability to convert on 3rd and 18.
What a catch
AMEN
#dola 
Oh god if he doesn't catch that it's a pick
Apparently clear blocking is now considered holding by this thread
Knee down and auto touched
Playoff Dola
I think the NFL erred by moving the umpire from the defensive backfield to the offensive backfield.  It's harder to see holding from where they are now.
Eagles
"Dola is clutch all the time,
"
Finally another flair calling it out.  Guy thinks he's so much smarter than the defense
It's only six inches but it sure  smells like a foot!
I don't think that throw was for Danny, I think he just INT'D a throw to Cooks.
fucking pathetic lol like show up for the game ffs
GOAT 
Danny boy!!!
Not over yet! 
LETS GOOOOOOOO
Dooooooooola
A packers fan should be able to spot it easily it's all your oline does
Dola deserved that TD. Great effort.
AMEN
LET'S GO BRADY! RIP THEIR HEARTS OUT. DEFENSE DO YOUR JOB!

Playoff Amendola! 
FUCKING YES!!!
Amendola always shows up when they need him :D
omg finally
I love you Touchdown Tommy
Fuck Yeah Danny 
holy shit Dorsett lmao
No matter what happens, this has been a spectacular game thus far. Great plays by both teams.
Patriots fans just can't get anything. If the Jags win you complain, if the Pats win you complain about something else. How about just focusing on that your team might win? You are focusing too much on the negative instead of enjoying the game.. jeez.
They haven't been calling any holds except the obvious tackle one. It's not every play but both sides have held their fair share. 
Well, that just kinda had an air of inevitability about it, didn't it?
Remember when Welker cost us a Superbowl dropping a better ball than that?
DOLA!!!!! OK defense, keep it going!
Win or lose, BRADY IS A LIVING GOD
Tom Brady in the 4th quarter isn't fair.
Nah
Fuckin Danny is so clutch it's not even funny
What would we do without Amendola? The guy comes alive in the playoffs
My heart can't fucking take this. Our 2 best receivers out in Brady we trust come on defense 
Great fucking drive. That 3rd and 18 was SO clutch.
Holy shit can we actually do this?
Dola is Mr clutch
Vikings. Bill Burr was fully correct about Philadelphia. Also a home team in the super bowl would be fun.
"""Brady knows he doesn't have to overthrow the receiver because the linebacker will never turn around""

God that's that good Romo shit."
You must not watch football then.
oooooh
Yes! 
HAHAHAHA SHITSONVILLE SUCKS
T O M M Y T O U C H D O W N 
But weâ€™re not
Yea the refs are making your defenders miss their covers.
Here we come bitch
Ye 
And that's why we paid Dola over Welker God bless Wes, and he gave us wonderful prediction, but Dola is too fucking clutch.
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
Come on defense 
I don't think so.
[YUP!](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oeSAD00YsGzUPTmqA/giphy.gif)
Vikings!!!
TB12=TD7
"DAMN DANNY!

Amendola is a sneaky Pats hero. We talk so much about Jules, Gronk and White but Danny just keeps showing up when we need him most."
COME BACK TOM!
Yâ€™all already know the ending....
Brady is a fucking animal.
TOM BRADY ENTERING GOAT MODE!!
We did it to the falcons!! We can do it to the Jags!!!!
What did the refs do? They threw the ball for Brady?
D could be getting tired. jags always start out hot early
"any given Sunday
"
holy shit Dola
AMENDOLA CAN FUCK MY PARROT
Because he was down by contact? He and Lewis were tied up going to the ground.
Lmao
Brady with another GOAT drive. NBD 
THERE WE FUCKING GO
Pretty good, considering Gronk is out
"The Jaguars front 4 is finally slowing down. They're not getting an edge quite as quick, giving the Pats offensive line enough to keep them outside.

Edit: Wow the Jaguars are still winning yet y'all are still salty."
What about now?
God, I fucking love Amendola. So fucking clutch with those hands. 
#THE PATS ARE COMING
Still have a 3 point lead. Thats still a good lead to have
We got a game 
Danny Canendola
if brady pulls this off.......
Mr Fucking Clutch 
Adjustments
Lol Vancouver 
I love you Danny.
What a drive! Letâ€™s go defense
THATS MY QB!
thank you for not choking the PAT Gostkowski
Down on the ground with Lewis
Playoff Amendola is a whole new animal
That's cause Christ plays QB for us
welcome to playoff threads with the patriots!
r/nfl, "You feel it too, don't you?" 
">Did Amendola just steal that ball from the receiver behind him? 

Maybe, definitely, i don't know"
Finally the refs give us a score 
I dont care what happens in this game, Brady is incredible. 
Its happening. They drove it down field twice if they didn't fumble that. Just need a STOP and Brady is doing it.
Down by contact. He was still touching the running back while on the ground with the ball
"5/7 for 80+ yards. 

Must be the fucking refs "
DOLA DOLA BEELS Y'ALL
If the Jags win, Vikings. If the Patriots win, Eagles. Vikings because I'd rather not watch a game with single digit final scores, and Eagles because as far as I can tell the Patriots match up against them better.
That's what I'm taking about! Refs screw you with that rumble call, get the ball back and score
BASED BRADY 
They also couldn't come back down 25 in the super bowl
Idk why we didn't just throw it every play earlier, they can't stop it.
The Patriots have aged me no less than 10 years 
Pats win with discipline, and Coughlin's just about the only coach/exec as discipline-forward as Belichick
SHEEEESH
Roll Tide?
Down by contact
Guess not 
ALRIGHT LET'S DO THAT FOOTBALL
YUP
Alright buddy.
Always seems to be a 3rd and long. But we're not home yet
LMFAO that's legit funny
3:19 on that drive. Good shit. Cooks double move is coming.
Im a wreck. Throw it to fucking Dola. D needs to make a play. 
If pats pull this off, I will rub hot sauce on my balls and let my girlfriend lick it off, and Iâ€™ll record it
Win or Lose I love Tom Brady 
A rampage movie... Interesting
Danny fucking Amendola
REVENGE OF HARAMBE
We all know about Danny. 
I love Amendola with all of my soul
Romo is a prophet
He was down by contact tho
Fuck KD
I like you
Refs helping out hugely on that drive. Fix is in
They're a very stable defence
/r/nfl is so triggered
Thank you refs for getting us that touchdown. Let me know where to send the check
We call him AMENdola for a reason baby! 
My I ask why? I can understand Edelman but Dola?
No
"This is where we'll see if Bortles has what it takes.

He staved off Ben repeatedly last week. Now we'll see if he can do it to Brady. "
Danny Amendola has hands steadier than a fucking surgeon 
I feel like you calling yourself biased is fair.
I was waiting. I texted NY 30 minutes ago and they just got around to it
You want to make me the best soldier possible. Go down and look at the standings. Look at the all-time standings. So far you're doing an excellent job with me. Congratulations. Now when are you going to put me up against a good army?
i will buy them all glasses after this game, just stay blinded for now
I have no problem with that
Rampage is King Kong lite
It's the rock just blowing shit up. What's to hate? 
Schizophrenic much?
Danny Clutchamendola
TD there is massive. Now the defense only needs to hold them to a fg to give Tom a chance.
He's shifty. A real gym rat
Kinda yeah
AMENDOLA YOU FUCKING AMAZING MAJKLNVSRAGNFDSKM GRNEAFKVAR
GOAT.
You know whats coming.
its the same beat
plz no
They called him down. 
LMFAO YALL STILL WHINING ABOUT THE REFS?????  
Bills still suck. Sorry.
"Jags 20

Refs 17"
His nickname is "Mr Clutch" for a reason
I'm happy that Gronk is getting movie roles now.
Rampage looks like a fun "shut your brain off flick."
this guy watches the pats
just stop
Anything besides a jags td please...
Man the one drive we make plays people bitch about holds now lol love r/nfl
STOP GIVING ME HOPE, PATRIOTS, IVE ALREADY RESIGNED MYSELF TO OUR LOSS
There's at least 6 new conspiracies each drive! 
pats game threads are garbage on both sides. playoff games are especially awful.
Must be nice to have your team cheap shot the other teamâ€™s second best player out of the game. 
Amendola just may be the most clutch Pats reciever ever
Maybe Jack shouldn't have spiked the ball and instead ran to the end zone. There have been times where the td gets awarded
"â”¬â”´â”¬â”´â”¤(ï½¥_â”œâ”¬â”´â”¬â”´

Pats fans slowly coming out from hiding"
They score even more when their best receiver isn't targeted and removed from the game on a dirty play.
RAMPAGE WAS A GREAT GAME
The ball was thrown, and the DB initiated contact
If rampage doesn't have a monster punching down a building I'm going to be pissed
Lol he was down you bozo
You could fill the grand canyon with all the salt in this thread.
We have the GOAT QB.
Yes yes. Let the hate flown through you
I feel so blessed to have Tom Brady as my quarterback
You guys remember when Aaron Donald came out to Under Pressure by David Bowie?
It really is. Thanks for the compassion, we just canâ€™t catch a break these days!
I mean as long as your dog isn't named "my girlfriend" that's cool. 
He is like playoff wes welker back in the day
$$$$$
I know shits crazy right. Loved that game when I was a kid.
Why couldn't we play Pittsburgh? We could've ass-blasted em. Smh the Jags are spooky
"Hey, I have a great idea for a shitty movie who should we get to star in it. 

Umm just get the rock he act in anything. "
Yes you will. 
No that's a normal response.
I have faith the D can make a huge stop here.  LET'S GOOOO!
game ain't over till it's over 
Calais Campbell is a big human
"I HAVE A RAGING ERECTION FROM THAT DRIVE 

EDIT: THE DOWNVOTES ONLY ENCOURAGE ME"

This is insanity. 
what?
But that game was so good 
ya right. everyone in here is addicted to football.
Well I switched my flair, complained about an OPI that I completely made up, and got 6 upvotes. That was fun
He's a cool guy but all the things he's in are shit.
Do you not want to see them possibly lose in the SB? Vikes/Eagles Ds are also good.
"Really? Because if there wasnâ€™t a dirty hit on Gronk I bet we score more
"
Do Apple users take that many selfies? 
GTAV!! 
HAHAHAHA WE COMING BACK
I like him because he appears to be a great person. He's still a mediocre actor, though
Jacksonville has held every play every drive, but /r/nfl says nothing 
That defense is scary. If jags hold it together, I'm rooting jags in the SB . 
Amendola: Mr fucking sure hands.
I think so lol.
Every play there is holding both ways. It's what the line does
Puffed? 
Goooooooo!!!!!
Given that Vanilla Ice got the baseline from Queen and David Bowie... not really.
I am very stressed out right now. 
Hot take! 
ðŸ˜
"You can't go into Dwayne Johnson movies and expect some well written, top teir acting to a great story.

You gotta expect cgi, poor acting and yet something fun to watch."
Game ainâ€™t over - nice to see clutch playoff Dola yet again tho. That 3rd and 18 pass...
Maybe.
The Rock doing too much
Young Sheldon bless upon us
i gotta thank mr kraft and his checkbook, without it, this would not be possible.
The twist is the Monkey eats the Rock halfway through.  
I think they need a TD here honestly.  They stayed just ahead of Pitt that way
We need bortles to turn into a pumpkin 
Fuck we need to stop them
My guess it was the sideline ref who didn't see the loss of control, so he saw Lewis go down and called the play dead
not sure ya'll want to play this jags team tho
There is holding on every single pass play get over self
Fix your team first!...
Waaaaaaahhhbb
This drive defines how this game goes. Let's see if BDB is ready to rise ul
Such is the Pats life
Won't rack up fantasy points but he'll get the team out of a hole
Giant animals destroying shit.

+1 from me that interview was hilarious 
Squirrelly boi
DILLY DILLY 
why?
they're probably paying him 20M
What gave it away
I'm just saying they call that penalty no matter what hits first. I agree that it's tough to call
A three and out would be pretty great 
Gonna? Catch up, son
I dont think officials have called it all game.
No penalties that drive and this thread still whines about refs.
I think it's based on a video game from the 80s. Those are always great...
Amendola is so fucking clutch
Sadly, that's 100% true.
I take it you've seen how this movie ends.
Slater is fired up
Sure, but does he get even close to the airtime of Jules, Gronk, White or Lewis?
I thought last year would've shown you that, but I'll take what I can get.
Thanks John Madden 
These Fords look so tough I'm about to buy two of em.
doesnt take science to see most people hate the Pats. Just goes with winning
Love the special teams playing fierce 
Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within and Advent Children were pretty good
Because they're a well coached and disciplined team that commits few penalties? Nah fuck that, DAE REFS ARE FIXING THE GAME? 
This is one of the most fairly called games I have seen all season and people are still complaining about the refs. 
Seriously? Are you saying there wasnâ€™t contact between the pats and jags player going down on that fumble recovery?
Mohammad Ail
"When will you fucking /r/nfl peasants learn, this team plays the best whey you count them out. 10 point game means nothing.

I like the way you think
We won it last year without him. We can do it again.
Not true.
Lol, don't think anyone on r/NFL will hold against ya bud
"can't throw the long ball at his old age"... Airs it out multiple times with an injured hand. 
Our defense has been thrash except for a few drives. This is on them right now.
Great description.
We hate you too 
Holding happens on literally every play of every game. 
Slater is so quick it almost always catches me off guard
Just like jax DBs...
Worst PI ever? You've definitely got your hater shaders on! I've seen that called and not called in so many games.

Why on earth would a Titans fan root for the Jags?

Youâ€™re goddamn right
Danny AMENdola!
Did apple buy your Reddit account?
Patriots look fired up. Let's go!!!
Lol
This is correct.
I smell a turnover
Weâ€™re winning
LIVIN' ON A PRAYER!
it's all they have left
"> You hate him for toying with you and making you think you might lose.

Win?"
Sometimes it seems that way.  Or, just don't defend the bootleg screen, he hasn't been doing that often, except every game this season.
because they basically are
Are we gonna ignore that the most blatant hold the entire game has been by the Jags? At least the Pats o-line isn't fully tackling d-linemen.
Tony is so excited 
I love how hype special teams players get
STOP RUNNING
Happens every kick. Find something else to complain about
Try watching Ballers on HBO. Its different than his typical movies and a decently enjoyable show
"Nah man Iâ€™m having a fucking heart attack

I have no faith in the defense"
Thought that was gonna be manning face tbh
Tony romo is everyone rn
Felt like he was trying to prevent a turnover. 
Hooooo doggyyyy, love me some good special teams play!
Thanks bro 
Iâ€™ve seen this before
Ohoohohohoho
Tony Romo's boyish giggling lol
LETS GO BABY!
Fuck, I wish! I was just responding to the commercial about it's camera.
Up by 3 with 8 minutes to go against the Greatest QB of All Time. I'd be fucking terrified if I were the Jags
Same, with giggles attached.
Hard to believe there were people on /r/patriots saying he wouldnâ€™t make the team in preseason 
"My bud just said "" I bet Romo's wife is happy when he's out of the house.""

A little mean, but he's animated as fuck today lmao
"
It's the refs, it's a conspiracy, waaah!!!!
We're already hated enough without your shilling
If you want to call that, go back and look at the Jags defense throughout the first half. Like it or not, theyâ€™re letting them play, and letting them be chippy. 
"Yes, but the ""got the ball back"" was regaining control, not actually establishing possession. It's the exact same ruling that was made in the Austin-Sefarian Jenkins touchback.

If it was a catch attempt instead of recovering his own fumble it would have been ruled as interception instead of a fumble (since possession wasn't established after the initial fumble)."
Time for Bortles to see if he still has the clutch factor after last week.
oh my god, I'm a pats fan, I just like the flair ffs.
slater is so amazing
Y'all are fucked now.
Keep 8t loud!
Yes, please Blitz
Can say that for both teams, there's practically holding in the trenches all the time. Same with WRs and DBs just matters what gets seen by the refs
"Me when I hear Oprah should run for pres: lolololol

Me when I hear Rock should run for pres: hmmm..."
"Here is a free official CBS stream for ppl who cant watch 

http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/live/stream/"
It's a good time in the game for the Pats to get amped up. 
"watching football for romo is equivalent to Christmas AM for a 5 yr old
"
Slater such a beast. 
Fucking hell
My heart can't take it
20-16.  Pats scored a TD, and won it on a blocked punt with 0 sec left on the clock...this game is far too close to that for my comfort level.
Bortles is officially Eli 2.0
come on!!! stop them. fucking bortles
It's getting annoying
Get to the afc championship again somehow 
Well Jags got to kick Gronk in the head after his concussion, so I guess it just goes this game. 
that's pretty much what the actual pro bowl game is like too.
Bortles can pull out his own clutch magic here. 
GET LOUD
Ive been a Pats fan all my life. This past year has just been so shitty for me that I fully expected us to lose 
I love how excited Romo gets during moments like these
Anyone else get the impression Romo would be a decent coach based on his broadcasting? 
Josies on vacation far away
I hear whiskey is good for drinking away the pain
Barstool
Dude, Bortles has been balling. Dont short change him.
I love how they maul him after tackling him
Ya but brady was talked about that way for several weeks, not several seasons?
Got to play disciplined, need a stop here badly
Win the Superbowl this year and then figure shit out in the off-season is what I'm guessing. 
This D is long overdue for a turnover. 
Is fournette gassed
That's at least 3 times with Rooster now
Solid game, that's for sure.
Let's go, we need an interception!
He's been balling thanks to play action passes. That only works when there is a run threat.
TB12 bro
Please donâ€™t go full Flacco
Honestly, if the Jags win this I absolutely want them to win the SB too
fuuuuuu
Oh come on, we'renot nearly that evil. 
Was a good picture though
Yes for sure, they're playing a great game
Almost picked ugh! 
Great coverage!
You might want to get that checked out
Damn Gilmore should of had that
Damn right through Gilmores arms. 
Shhhhhhhh. Shhh. Let's not even think about it. Still salty about that trade. Hoyer isn't worth a damn and we haven't ever had a stable running back in a long time
Oh God I almost thought he caught it.
Super Troopers 2 as well... Catering to their audience 
Way too soft on d
Bortles isnâ€™t that smart. 
"Some great decision making from Bortles though, it feels like either his guys are open or he's throwing it away.

Doesn't feel like there have been many contested balls."
#goatles
ELITE BORTLES
Who?
I hope Denver never realizes that John Elway is a terrible gm and they keep for a decade.
Gilmore you had that 
Since both coordinators are leaving it might as well be almost like starting over.  Hopefully they have some good replacements in mind and are able to field a less bend but don't break and more dominate defense next season.
Bortles ainâ€™t shit
GOAT Time!
COMEBACK KID COMEBACK KID COMEBACK KID
Itâ€™s HAPPENING 
For everyone complaining about the non holding call on pats, explain that non holding call and how if it goes both ways the refs are biased?
DAAAAA RREEEFFFFFFSSSSSS
Lol. Remember when everyone said more contact on Hogan wasn't interference? 
Didn't throw those flags against you, you will not get those flags for you.
GARBAGE TIME BORTLES
Let's fucking GO!
lets go
Lmao.
Good stand 
their same handful of plays have been wrecking us all game
Yes
No flag? Praise refs!!!
This is a great game. Whichever teams wins has earned it.
Donâ€™t count out Touchdown Tom.
Ok Tom, you can do this.
We got this! Jaguars about to blow this lead
Its to eat clock, they need to eat time of the clock to prevent the other team from getting the ball if they get a stop
What on that play warranted a flag?
man what is this feeling???
Like opi or dpi? Seemed as if Dede was trying to defend it from being picked 
DILLY DILLY
Figuratively*
There's a gazillion questionable calls being granted to every team. Yeah we've had our fair share. I've also seen our opponents get a fair share. It's whatever. It's salt inducing but I've learned to deal with it. 
"No CaLl FuCk ThEsE ReFs

You all selectively forgetting Hogan giving a defender a piggy back ride in the first amuse me. Oh no cause it's the Pats lmao. "
"lol id love to see the vikings play but these jags are scary af

id rather be playing the steelers right now

if you're rooting for good TV id still pick the pats because hey, who doesn't want to watch the home team defeat the champions"
"They have let the Jags get away with several PIs, were you bitching then? 

Wasn't any PI there anyways"
Fake news 
Dad-Dick? Lmao! Haven't heard that before
"I'd watch that.  

"
They aren't old enough to get that 
â€œThe IBM block chainâ€ please no
They've been pretty lose on PI all game.  They've been consistent.
Fuck off they've been letting them play all game. This ref is notorious for not throwing the flag 
I really didn't think I could hate a team that has been so bad for so long, but congrats Jagwires.. get fukt
Yeah except when we didn't in the first quarter in the exact same situation, except beyond the sticks. 
Fair.
False.  
Wasn't against hogan in the first half 
Totally.
Come on man, just don't 
Holy fuck this thread is toxic. No DPI on having a hand on the guy. You mean the thing that every corner does every play? 
Within 5 yards
Jags special teamers didn't get in Amendola's face to shit talk after that fair catch. How come?
Romo: " how has Bortles not felt the playoff pressure yet? I usually felt it by the last game of the season."
Nope.
[...do you want him to look like this?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1a1kzZVQAETtcv.jpg)
Lol. The pats are getting non calls that could be called too.
Despair 
That's just hate bias. Then again, I also have bias towards the Pats. Who's to say if that's actually true or not but we can't argue this because we'd be stuck all day. 
Well yeah. But he can still be not the smartest user of the play clock. 
I'm having salt and vinegar chips, they taste just like this thread 
yea they suspended brady for 4 games cause they love him so much
LET'S GO PATS. NOT DONE YET!!!
I'm pullin out every superstition I've ever had right now, from my lucky slippers to not talking to my dad.
Yes, in the first or second quarter. 
There's no way that was DPI Pats D just shut down Bortles. We knew he was gonna choke eventually
Lol butthurt Giants fans
HAHAHAHA SHOW ME YOUR HATE
All you guys acting as if it's over. Pats are still losing
We think it's actually a pencil shaped growth. 
There it is
6 minute drill!
That guy has to still be likable no matter what team. Clutch as fuck
First of all. Good fucking game Jags, you'd deserve to win
They weren't calling it on Jax all game either, they're at least consistently garbage.
Not exceedingly confident at all. Cautiously optimistic.
Bouye knocked the shit put of cooks on our last drive and would have done the same thing to him if Danny didn't catch it instead. They're letting both sides do it, stop crying,

Lol ok bro
Maybe you have a different rule book when watching the pats... 
Pretty sure there was a missed hold on the O-line too...
The only thing I'm exceedingly confident of is the fans here bitching about every call.
I'm a huge Pats fan, but I literally have gotten sick to my stomach because multiple times it looked like we got away with blatant PI. Sorry Jags fans, those were some tough calls. 
Oh yeah because the jags bring in so much revenue
I can't say that's true or not because of my bias. 
Refs have allowed that D play on receivers all day, suddenly it's an issue when it's a Jags receiver?
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Explain the help, sources?
They are calling it even. They missed at least 2 pi on the jags
They don't. Plenty of calls go against them. We all think the refs are biased against us. It's human nature. 
"Yes, several. But that doesn't support your narrative. 

But you're suprised Belichick teams commits less penalties than other teams?  Lol. You must be new"
Well, here comes the inevitable
He was inside 5 yards, contact is allowed. Didn't turn him. You'll never see that called.
Muh PI like the jags left tackle didn't fucking lay on the pass rusher. Fuck you bums
I actually might puke right now 
Tom Brady knows de wey.
Too late.
Shitting my pants
Certainly not over. Jags are a solid team so you can't call this till it's over
Are the tin foil hats always on this tight when the Pats play?
No itâ€™s not
Uh have you seen our playoff games, almost always close and down to the wire 
did that this morning, its not it
Bitch at supermarket clipped me like that on Thursday. 
This drive upcoming is for everything
Let the hate flow through you.
You mean all the oline holding pats players?
it's a race against time
Not over yet. 
"1st quarter, pats possession: ""Nice to see the refs are letting them play""

4th quarter, jags possession: ""THROW THE FLAAAAAAAAG REFS""

At least they're being consistent."
LETS DO THIS PATS!
Down by three. I've seen this movie before. 
This is such an excellent game
<3
L O L 
So true.
You may need to keep the vinegar handy
Except when the jags did it in the first quarter it wasn't flagged. Consistent reffing, even if it is wrong
Here we go. Let's feast boys ðŸ˜ˆ
Raising Canes.
Sadly this is only slightly worse than your average pats game thread
It was a 9 point spread, what had happened today that makes you think Vegas was involved 
How are you going to call DPI when the receiver shoves the defender to the ground, yet stays on his feet, and still misses the ball?
Relevant username
nah i gotta be reminded
The hate is unreal, but I'm so used to it it's funny.
60k comments LET'S GOOOOO
###[PSA This is the lions next head coach](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1a1kzZVQAETtcv.jpg)###
I'm a Pats fan, but I'm not *completely* degenerate. 
Got tired, started getting stuffed at the line
"Riddle me this: how could a single team buy all of the ref squads in the league? Kraft isn't any more wealthy than the other owners (not counting the Packers). 

"
So glad you were around to say that in Q1 when Hogan got the cape treatment. I guess only Pats fans bitch for our calls and everyone else bitches about everything else.
It was the one drive where gronk got hurt, 1-15 and the one PI will make all that up 
Plus the vinegar
Liquor help you no matter who you're going for
Engage GOAT mode.
Is it? 
Everything is a Blockchain now... 
Yeah man fuck your dad
Seriously, Blake who? 
Best comment of the thread
Isn't every non-Patriots fan a Jags fan right now?
thanks bruh
most of it is from 2 penalties a PI and a helmet to helmet
Plus holding against our dline
This seems like a pretty plausible scenario.
Vinegar is sour.
That amazing Pats '01 defense not talked about because of how good Brady has become since they won him that championship. Also in 2000 the Ravens won with a top 5 all time defense, Bucs did it in '02 with same thing. Brady's success after the fact and the other defenses of those 3 years makes their contribution look worse. But the first Super Bowl(if not the first 3) are a product of the defense.
It would have been on Gronk for OPI.  
Thatâ€™s just because there isnâ€™t an unnecessary stabbing penalty in the game yet.
Is anyone really going to watch a Jags Superbowl? The NFL has been angling to move that team to London for years
People complaining about Pats PI: Where the fuck were you when the Jaguars caused DPI? Please fuck off with your hypocrisy.
There are a lot of outrageous comments in this thread lol
And bragging I shall not do. 
Easy pi.
#YES
Thanks for wrapping your arm around
lol seen this before.  chance to win it, fail, other team goes down gets a 3, one last chance, fail.  what a tired script.  i'm watching so of course we lose.
Lol
DPI AS FK
Why do people just assume that Pats will score now? Jags are playing like studs. 
Inc salt
"Refs are calling a consistent game

This thread: the fix is in."
You cant do that
Code yellow, boys! 
HAHAHAHA. Can't wait for thread to explode after blatant DPI.
Pretty blatant PI
CHOKE
Lmao he hooked his neck and threw him down. People really hate the Pats. It's amazing. 
Fuck outta here. He grabbed him around the neck
Do you think that wasn't interference 
Come on guys, we all know grabbing around the helmet like that is a flag
Are you joking? He's pulled him like 6 yards. 
Fuck them for calling obvious PI
That was a clear pi
This topic is hilarious. Ramsey hooks him around the neck before the ball is there and people are pretending it's a bad call.
That was obvious DPI you guys are silly
It's because he assaulted the WR
Can't argue that PI 
I think this is the part of the game where Brady goes deep cooks and gets picked. 
"That was pretty obvious DPI.
"
These game threads are great reminders why none of us are refs
I was talking about the contact before. After he put his hands on him but didn't turn or push him. Those haven't been called all game. The only PI was from pushing a guy OB with his hands and obvious extension.
Lol, keep telling yourself that buddy, that last call was unfair too right, or did ramsey not drape himself on cooks?
Lol you guys need to learn when theres actually bullshit calls before getting ypur panties in a bunch
He litterally grabbed him by the neck....
Just refresh the feed. 
Guys... that was PI.
He grabbed him around the neck.   Are you guys seriously bitching about that call?
While being all over him. Cmon 
I love how non Pats fans are questioning that call. It was an obvious PI.
Oh hey looks like neither team can get a PI
You should probably sit down and have some alcohol.
Bouye just can't cover Cooks. Either he leaves a huge cushion and Cooks beats him on a comeback or he plays tight and has to get PI.
He pulled him down by the neck...
with his arm around the receiver's neck...
Acting like Ramsey should get to grab on as he goes by. lol
Lol
"Do you guys know what a PI is?

Stop being salty."
Because there was an obvious PI? What should they have done? Not thrown the flag? Not done their job?
Actual penalties don't  count anymore
Lol he wrapped his hbd around his neck when the ball was still coming down, grow up
His arm was around Cooks' neck before the ball got there.
Tom "Joe Flacco" Brady
You're way too late for that.
Brought his head right up into the chin. hmmmmm
It's the Flacco special.
That was legit PI though I can understand the salt given there was holding on Jacksonville's 3rd down.
I don't know how anyone can defend that PI being thrown on Ramsey. That was blatant and an easy call.
that call was obvious
I'm surprised so many fans hate the pats, we should have fans in Houston, and now Titans, 49ers. Potentially Indy and Detroit. We are just trying to improve the NFL.
How can anyone see that and not think its PI? He wrapped his neck 
It appears that the referees are calling penalties.
If you don't want PI calls. Don't commit obvious PI.
Obvious dpi..... omg the refs suck fix is in for the pats. 
I'll be honest, in real time I didn't think that was a flag... The replay was more than conclusive, you certainly can't have your arms around the neck of the receiver.
You fucks, he grabbed him around the neck
Someone in here gonna claim that wasnt pi?
The Pats had a play where they hooked a receivers neck and dragged him down? 
I canâ€™t believe thereâ€™s people arguing that wasnâ€™t PI. 
"*Arm around the neck*

/r/nfl : WHAT THE FUCK! 

lmao"
Hey Jacksonville
Cooks was mauled on that one. That was a fine call.
ANYONE WHO SAYS THAT ISN'T DPI YOU'RE FUCKING BLIND
"I'll take ""Patriots failed third down conversion"" for 500, Tony.

*daily double noise*"
Patriots legend James Harrison 
patriots legend james harrison 
We donâ€™t get called for dpi cuz we donâ€™t fuckin commit it
Fucking hitting a rusher in the back, tell me that isnt a flag lol fuck yall 
Punt? That's a gutless call that will most likely lose the game
Patriot legend James Harrison
Loving the game plan of making Bortles beat us
wonder who the conversion will go to
This is /r/nfl.  You know the answer to that.
FG RANGE!!!!
Nice field position 
Umm yeah? Should I root for Gronk to get targeted cause of that? Lol
I can admit there have been some calls that have gone the Patriots way but holy crap that 2nd down throw was not PI lol
THIS IS IT
All three phases of the game!
BIG. DICK. DOLA.
The refs let Danny run that back 20
AmenDOLA
Fg range
Well yeah, but what does that mean? Whatâ€™s his role during the games?
Danny!
"""Egregious"" when the contact was the WR grabbing the DBs arm after the play. That's how it works.

Both played the ball."
Just making shit up now huh?
You have Jimmy.  Your time is coming
Wow honestly how dare the refs rig that punt wtf
What a punt!!!
Yessss. Give Brady another shot to crush everyone's dreams. 
S P E C I A L  T E A M S 
Dan ny am en dooooohhh laaaaa
Dola bringing out his best Edlemen impersonation
Canâ€™t believe the refs made him punt it so poorly!!
James Harrison pick 6 to end the game please 
So just looking through this thread. Most of the people talking shit are non Jags fans. 
teams play so scared vs the pats
lets go
YES!!!!!
Wow first time Amendola ran the ball of special teams today
I'm gonna shit myself. Like, literally
Field goal position to start the drive. Pats OP please nerf
"gotta stand up to brady" hasn't been a problem so far...
Just time for him to get his workout in is all
No way bro. The league is all about the Pats. That's totally why they pursued Deflategate so hard, even though there was a clear scientific explanation of what really happened.
Typical bitching about Pats fans
I SMELL BLOOD
Been a while since the last commercial. I love it!
It's one that doesn't get old. Timeless
Ate up 50 seconds...not optimal.
Or, they have one of the greatest coaches in the history of the league to help make adjustments throughout the game
stay classy 
Seriously? Come on man... Let's keep it clean.
Fuck you.
Don't quit now. Game isn't over
Play safe here Pats. 
Eat a dick. How's the offseason?
I've felt the opposite
RIP IN PEACE JAGS
Please run the ball a bit...
Bortles #1 receiver in the 4th is the ground.
Classic, just injure a player. Stay classy.
Moved from alcohol to caffeine, and my heart is starting to regret it
You're alright seachicken
This is James White time!
thank you james harrison!
I can't tell whether you're making fun of the "fix is in" or are one of them please let me know thx
Finally put Bortles on his back. We've needed to see a lot more of that today.
Roll for that 1st
Was it a legal block or tackle when I think fournette shoved the LB in the back when he was trying to get up? 
CLUTCH AS FUCK FROM DANNY
[IT'S HAPPENING](https://i.imgur.com/XjTmaiZ.gif)
Marrone looks nervous. 
D O T S
Dola!!!!!!
Amendola is CLUTCH
Has Lewis played a snap since his fumble?
Thread the needle
DANNY IS AMAZING 
Oh god I thought it was an int
Love you Dola. Never stop being clutch.
Dolla wants this
"You only get the lead Pats want you to have.
"
You're joking, right? Do you remember Tony having an orgasm on the Jags field goals?
He caught it
Are you not entertained?!
