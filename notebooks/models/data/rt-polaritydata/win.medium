Slater juuuust missed him
I think they need to turn up the intensity on that SWAT promo otherwise no one will watch it
Willie McGinnist on the Jumbotron
Thatâ€™s horrible. Donâ€™t wish that on your worst enemy.
mexican
Lol for real. I love Brady but we've barely seen him throw yet.
Itâ€™s okay. I love haters.
I dont understand what you people want. People are calling the league soft, but when guys start talking shit in game, you guys hate it. I love it when players talk trash. What's competitive sports without trash talking?
People don't actually the Jaguars will win, do they?
Whoa is that kind of overtime authorized for that SWAT dude?
I think they honestly just advertise to stay relevant because every other major car company is showing ads. I hope people are buying specific cars because they showed a commercial during football.
WHERE YOU GOIN?! No where!
How about you watch the game or get the f out of the thread. It's his throwing hand.
Field position game now d.  They won't be able to go 90+ yds every time.
Statistically dinking and dunking has been the way to beat them lol
C'mon man
Still not as bad as Fox Sports
">Celebrity Big Brother

I donâ€™t know half these people"
Can't run on us!
probably, but he will have to take a lot of pay cuts
Unless we get the Giordoni Air Rifle. 20 rounds 
1 regular season Eli please
Exactly 
Spoken like a steelers fan last week
"Hi Mom!"
Exactly
Ads more important 
I kind of like it
Here comes the Rooster
Pass rushers are usually the first to tire out.
I hate this acapella Kanye shit
Actually, [CBS is streaming the game for free](http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/live/stream/)
Watch it Bountygate 
Offense can switch players and focus them keep fresh and rest guys a little, even on the field, while D has to play has to play every down same. 
[check it out](https://www.removeddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7rxshx/great_news_as_armed_forces_network_will_air_both/) just some politics chat i guess
Right? It's been impressive.
I'm pretty happy with both versions
Defensive players generally get tired a little faster. And you can survive on offense with less energy than defense.
Dumbasses
Man our 90's unis were ugly.
The McDaniels effect 
boooooooo
I remember when we switched to the striped bright blue jerseys.  I was actually a fan, but man does it look dated now.
You guys meaning the numerous bills fans in every thread shit talking Gilmore all season. Not bills fans in general. Maybe don't read into internet comments so seriously and try to judge the character of an individual by them.
They need to chill with the commercials 
Oh man. Our defense getting killed by Bortles.
I'm not hitting the panic button, but the cover is flipped open my hand is over the button
Never celebrate until 0:00 
PEPE SILVIA
Strong drive for Jacksonville, looking like a good game
RemindMe! 3 hours
Probably the same as Brad Johnson. 
Give him the whole team salary cap 1 man team
Neither. Fournette is great, Bortles is pretty good, and the playcalling is excellent right now. 
I was wondering about that given emphasis on controlling throughout, but at the same time if that's not a catch the NFL is a joke
Good offensive gameplan by Jacksonville on that one. NE has trouble covering backs and TEs side to side due to the speed and they've honed in on it. This'll be a fun game if each team continues to avoid offensive mistakes.
Everytime I get nervous when the Patriots go down in a game, they always show the Nissan commercial with Hightower strip sack in SB 51, and get optimistic  
No the game is SURELY over. 
Woah, Pacific Rim 2 looks awesome.  Actually happens in daylight this time.
"I much as i know the entire nfl is against the Pats right now. This isnt cause for concern. Easy up on those memes fellas. 

Its gonna be a good game. "
Amen
It's still early, don't get a big dick.
NBC is
Just looks like a transformers knockoff. 
Different game plans. Pats are focusing on the rush and Jags are focusing on the pass.
MONSTER ROBOT CGI MOVIE YESSSSS
"""SEC! SEC! SEC!""

That's what you sound like"
I love watching everyone get hyped from a small lead against the Pats. It's pathetic and hilarious at the same time
"Hey guys, I know it would be rude, but what about not giving Bortles a fucking minute to find an open receiver?

"
That movie pacific rim or whatever movie looks stupid
Please watch... just please
Pacific Rim 2 looks dope. I wish I could watch that, but Iâ€™m stuck here watching our defense shit the bed.
REFS.. SAVE US!! (à²¥ï¹à²¥) 
So far not as bad as last week.  Premature celebrations are on equal pace though
Blake Bortles....playoff dragon?
I don't think this new Pacific Rim looks good at all.
"no, what's next is the *future*

what just happened is history"
This jags defense has always scared me man... 
Same thing happened in the Titans game.
Doesn't mean it isn't delicious
I don't like the vibe I get from this. Good defense, ok QB, getting burned on easy routes by TDs. This is like Denver two years ago
Did CBS tell Romo to tone down his comments??? He seems a little more reserved.
I'm seeing a lot of faded Steelers flairs. It is what it is. 
It's got what plants crave!
I am ready for Pacific Rim 2. 
How is jagwire actually pronounced? [Serious]
I feel like a lot of people here have intentional amnesia. Let's not get hasty calling the game early
Oooooo booooy
The first one sucked, how did it get a sequel?
Neither had Dion Lewis
Can they keep it up all game?
PACIFIC RIM SEQUEL HYPE
I'll never understand why directors of sports broadcasts think that fans want to watch the game from a shitty angle (the skycam, behind home plate, behind the net in hockey, etc)
Guys I'm scared.
Everyone drop your Bortles ï¾‰à¼¼àºˆÙ„Íœàºˆà¼½ãƒ½
Fuck you young Sheldon 
Game over. 
I too am in the Bay area, and I too am 2 beers in. Let's definitely get weird with it
Lewis what the fuck 
shit play calling so far
Bortles sucks lol. We will make half-time adjustments.
Jags D rested because they didn't play last week, right?
jag-wahr
how can I invest in this meme?
depends on your accent and dialect.
Pacific rim 2 looks good
Fuck as a pats fan and Uga student Iâ€™m triggered 
The AWS â€œcloudâ€
Them jagwires are looking good, we may be in a lot of trouble this quarter 
We're about to get Big Dick Bortled
Man what the fuck is this play calling
You are. That movie was tons of fun.
Brady so trash what is that, one missed pass. Definatley not goat. 
The lore is that they need both brains to process the robot's movemetns.
America's been struggling a bit. We're doing our best though
Just got back from the movies in time for the game, the trailer showed that it was a bad idea acting wise, but who knows..
Don't fucking go 3 and out after that scoring drive... 
There's a lot of early hype in this thread. I also remember when the Titans were up 7-0. 
Someone get McDaniels on a fucking bus to Indy. Jesus fucking Christ
This D is no joke.
If bortles throws 64 more tds he'll pass Tom Brady in playoff tds
Fucking shit
It's probably the only new comedy so it counts
Young Sheldon is so bad. How can anyone seriously watch that?
"Wait are the people saying the first TD is game over serious? Or what? Have you watched football before?

Jesus Christ 17 replies in 3 minutes."
We're the FUCK was the flag? 
You seem upset.  Why is that?
Did he hit that DB in the chest? Yessh that was close.
LOL DPI all day
no you didn't
He's being tackled!!!
wtf no flag?
That's PI and a half
Ugh
Hogan was wearing that defender on his back
Hogan was basically tackled and no DPI lolol
No, that's why they sync. But seriously, it is Pacific rim. Don't overthink it.
A first down swing pass and a second down draw. Iâ€™m going to throw up.
"Jeez, Colvin was draped all over him.

**Edit**: wrong defender.  Fixed."
It's gonna be one of those games we're PI isn't called huh
How is that not PI he was hanging off him 
The Pats get all the calls!!!!!!! 
All over Hogan 
I mean that's pass interference but whatever. Gotta play better
damn jags defense, lord have mercy
No it was so  the brains don't fry. So they train to be as similar as possible
TIL Mark Sanchez can go 7/9
So I guess we can hang on receivers now
People really don't like us
"Great defense." Sure, Tony.
That's what we call great defense now?
Jags really came to play. Pats better wake up
Turned hogan's body on that one. That should have been a flag
Great defense by turning the receiver's entire body before the ball got there!
He was grabbing Hogans shoulder before the ball was even there.  
How the fuck is that not a flag
I meant the Masters is my favorite sporting event, they can't tease me 3 months out
Time to put on the flame resistant suit
Okay is McDaniels aware that Brady, not Hoyer, did in fact make the start? Can we cool it with the goddamn screens and runs that are obviously going nowhere? 
Anyone corner is shut down when they're allowed to PI
Super tight window when you grab the receiver from behind before the ball is even close.  
Lmao that was pi... doesnt get more obvious than that
PI and late hit.  No call.  Remember this football fans. 
Not sure how that isn't PI.
just like last week!  ....oh wait...
Man this isn't looking good right now. Bortles playing substantially better than expected, and the Jags are getting pressure. 
The refs won't call anything. I don't know why we aren't calling illegal pick plays. 
Jacksonville is in control right now. 
Lol
Nobody make sure saints players dont sneak onto the sidelines and try to iniury anyone hurrdurr you're original and funny.
Zero flags so far
flair up
Our playcalling since the first drive has been weird again. 
That should have been dpi
Yeah the refs really favor us don't they
Yeah great â€œdefenseâ€
Yeah 7-3 how would we ever come back from that score
Jacksonville bailed out by refs
Great DPI there
Maybe ease up on the run McD, I know you got to keep them honest, but it is clearly not working 
That was obvious DPI.
*just McDonalds things*
I feel like his hand must be really screwed up
Made a play on the ball, of by ball you mean Hogan's back
Because it was. Colvin grabbed Hogans shoulder before the ball arrived
That was clear DPI
Ramsay and a bunch of other guys.
"> Yoooo that should have been ~~a pick~~ pass interference. 

Fixed. "
Yep, players from every other team in the league never do that. 
Yup, time to pack it up, and hang myself
">Great Defense

Uhh, you mean pass interference?"
tHe PaTRiOts AlWAyS gEt ThE cALls
That was textbook PI
Play calling has been atrocious so far. We keep repeating plays that don't work instead of going to what little has worked so far.
First touchdown. 
The Patriots will figure it out
Lol.
Nice playcalling McDaniels you pussy. Have fun shutting the bed again as a coach next year
Massive PI 
 It was PI though 
Can't expect much else from Clint Eastwood these days. Almost all of his recent films are just military circlejerks. I think he gets off thinking about military men tbh. 
It's the Jags. They've been mugging receivers like this all season and haven't been getting flagged.
Well when it's pass interference....
Did you not see Hogan's arm being held while he was going for the catch or are you blind 
PI was the entire Ravens offense for like 4 years 
He was riding Hogan lol. Looks like the refs are keeping the flags in their pocket today
Can't stop the anti-Pats circle jerk once it's begun
Didn't know Hogan was a horse. That Jaguar was riding him like he was in the Kentucky Derby.
They should give more commentary on Brady's hand.
One of the more obvious DPIs this playoffs...keep up the narrative that the pats get all the calls though 
I'd agree if he hadn't been making good throws already in this game
If they win ? Yes, duh
That was the first thing that should have been flagged 
Dude, I just read like 10 people post the Pats are done.
The defender turned Hogan by the shoulder. That's pretty simple interference.
Lol
Whoâ€™s the ref team this game 
That was definitely PI, Homer glasses off
Or any properly officiated game
...Brady?
Your QB literally schemes around drawing DPI.  Fuck outta here.
you can't make a good comeback attempt against the Jaguars defense like that. just ask Pittsburgh.
Jesus dude.
Tbh that was a bad call but back judge probably didnâ€™t see it. Happens ðŸ¤·ðŸ¼â€â™‚ï¸
This is bad and you should feel bad
Hard when they commit pass interference for sure 
">lbf 

NEWTONS OR GTFO"
You say to a 7-3 game...
That was PI.   
McDaniels has been garbage so far, hope he gets his head in the game. Way too passive.
Good DPI.
"JAG-WAR

I feel like with a British accent it's Jag-ooh-war tho. It's def not JAG WIRE, NANTZ. "
I dunno, I think you have Eli a bit high.
Yeah let's just make things up for upvotes.
Not gonna call that? Awesome. 
Itâ€™s 7-3..... have some faith, god damn 
It's the Patriots, they usually never get dpi calls in their favor
Thatâ€™s fine we have been laughing at falcons fans for almost a year. 
"This is a game people, this D for the Jags is for real, and Brady is not sharp. The over throw to Lewis in the flat was painful.


Pats D needs to make a play."
The jags defense plays similar to Seattle's, their LBs tend to drop to a deeper depth in pass coverage, leaving short underneath, and screens, open.
This makes me feel more confident for some reason
Yo soy fiesta
Hmm, no DPI?  That's fine as long as they hold back flags all game
Oh yeah I forgot you were allowed to ride on the back of the receiver before the ball was there, my bad.
Sure, if it's for Both sides. Doesn't normally happen that way tho 
Lol letting them tackle before the catch
I'll give your mom real issues
So many faded flairs in this thread talking shit. It's only the 2nd quarter...
"Clean"
Yeah, making that predication has never backfired before...
Are we watching football or commercials? No wonder ratings are down.
Oh of course they will
As long as the refs no call DPI like that both ways we will be fine.
Wait for the sequel Old Sheldon. Synopsis: He gets dementia 
Except for the PI they just missed on Hogan
This post has been mad every single year for the past 14
There is new rock music.  Lots of great bands out now.  Music is more accessible than ever.
All that traffic because they're blocking lanes to film that bullshit. 
"Traditional routes aren't going to get enough separation when they can get away with that much grabbing at the top of the route.

Guess we'll have to go to the tried and true pick plays that the Jags entire offense has been predicated on. "
Good to see that we've already moved on to the "game is over" and "refs are bought" phases of the game.
Why does Gronkowski, the largest receiver, not simply eat the other receivers?
On a clear PI lol
Great Defense.. I can also play defense If I am allowed to just drape myself over the receiver before the ball gets there. 
He's literally hanging on his shoulder before the ball gets there. Textbook PI
Good defenses make good decisions look bad.
Not counting them out.. it's a 4 point game lol.
When was the last time the giants were relevant again?
Ugh might need some halftime adjustments.
Literally just watched the Pats be down 7-0 last week against the titans, a bunch of people,including pats fans start talking about the pats getting beat, then they put up 35 straight. And now you're doing the same shit. SMH.
Maybe tbe asshole fans but when the defender is humping the receiver before the balls 5 yards away its pass interference. 
Hogan's body was turned before the ball got there. You aren't allowed to pull someone by their back shoulder.
Make sure there's a hole in the back of that suit so we can still shit on Dolphins fans.
I don't think the singleback/shotgun runs are going to get us anywhere this game. I form maybe, but it is still very early
Are you referring to Derek Bortles?
Next thing you know their going to interrupt our commercials with a football game.
Fuck you all I'm drunk 
*Hip beat instensifies*
Because he was draped all over him.
50 50?he turned hogan's body. That's as bad as dpi gets
"Pats need to go back to targetting the jags lbs in the pass.
"
I can already feel the Pat's hate coming out. Second half will be interesting
yep. I am fine as long as they call it the same both ways
Really? Philly is in the playoffs, why are you saying the phrase "It's always sunny in Jacksonville?"
Honda master race 
So early, but thee jags match up very well against us.
k
Iâ€™d say it shoulda been PI if the ball had even been close, but it really wasnâ€™t so 
I think it's more gameplan. Jags bad at covering rbs, great at wrs
I wish
We won the SB last year bro..
BACK TO SQUARE ONE
50% of why I want the patriots to win today is to shut up all the annoying anti-pats bandwagoners in here.
and thereâ€™s the first flag
Cant stand watching this right now. A bunch of people in the room are talking about irrelevant shit and I can't pay attention to the game, they just won't stfu. Someone help me. 
In what way did I backpedal?
Wait, there are refs at this game?
"Show of hands please:

-who actually watches these network shows?

-who enjoys Chevy commercials?

Last question,

Who hurt you?"
You know you can pick within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage right? That was 100% legal. 
Who willingly names their kid Clete?
Jags will be legit with Kirk Cousins
Jesus this blocking is insane
This grant dude is killing us
Not sure how that wasn't PI
He filled up on Tide Pods
That penalty did a whole fucking lot....
Good blocking by the Jags there.
Lmao so much holding by 11 on that play but no call
Maybe we can play defence tho
who is grant im worried
They can just dump it off to their backs all day long, we can't cover 'em
Pats defense is so bad. Jags SB winners?
Who willingly names their kid Blake Bortles?
Who is Grant? Iâ€™ve honestly never heard of this dude 
I think good defenses donâ€™t get flagged there.  They get reputation bonus. 
Can't set an edge smh
MOAR FLAGS ON THEM  PLEASE
Grant has been running the same play already. We should preped for that 
Oh jesus.. 
Nothing will ever be worse than that apple commercial. Nothing.
Can't rely on this D too much. 
That's good bait, I knew it was and still almost bit, well done.
Well we're done. Brady evidently can't throw and Bortles is picking us apart. 
bortles is seriously impressing me right now. never thought i'd say that. 
"The Playoff picture comes together"
Jesus fuck
plenty o game left. this pats defense is fucking garbage. everyone is wide open.
K.
Team pls
That was someblown coverage
Jesus Christ man, this is why people call so many pats fans bandwagon fans
When the fuck is our defense gonna show up to the game?
I guess we're just not going to play defense today. 
What is this defense doing?
Hoyer is not a bad QB?
Thanks for proving my point :)
Rowe...wtf
This zone isn't working.. wide open guys all over the place. Just give tight coverage and Bortles can't make those throws
Defense looks stupid. Patricia going to have HC offers rescinded at this rate. 
The ultimate strawman.
Yeah actually
no but there's an NCIS: Enterprise
I love all the salt in here, if they aren't a Pat's fan, they are rooting for the jags.  Minus 7 people, maybe.  
Itâ€™s not over until 00:00
Defense is looking all sorts of confused today, much like week 1.  Its not defcon1 yet, but the pacing has started in my household
Where our DBs at
Usually the Jags just dont commit penalties.  The titans should try it some time
That's the garbage ass defense we all know. Brady is gonna have to bail out Belichick once again.
The coverage isn't great.
Lions, please take Patricia! Jesus fuck.
Pat's D looks confused. 
I ask myself the same everytime still have not been able to figure it out!
Whoâ€™s doing these terrible hip hop promos between drives??
Yea god forbid!
man, we're definitely getting outmanned on these blocks
Still a lot of time left.  Defense just needs to make adjustments and execute better.
I'm impressed refs can catch small movements like that
Our D sucks again
Is it getting alittle hot in here
Jesus is the D even trying?
Great poise by Bottles.  Impressed
Belichick caught with his pants down right now.  
What's a pass rush?  /s
"Jacksonville fans: ""We got them! It's over!""

Jets, Dolphins, Bills, Seahawks, Falcons fans: ""Let's wait until the 4th quarter"""
We're gonna have to put up 40+ to win aren't we
LOL Tony doing a breakdown, but the replay was the false start
It really is. It's surprising we came this far really. The secondary gives up so many yards
Jesus, guys are literally wide open.
I can't believe we're being Bortled
Bend donâ€™t break is breaking us 
When does Brady get pissed? I want pissed Brady
Really not sure what the game plan is on defence here. They aren't rushing Bortles, they aren't playing anything resembling tight coverage, and they pick up the screens. I'm not loving it, that's for sure.
Yeah, I said the same thing during the Super Bowl last year. 
"Youâ€™re doing more than that. The offense is really playing to their strengths right now, and your defense is shutting us down. 

This defense is fucking legit "
All of the commercials suck. Apple, DirectTV, Chevy I mute them every time
Eh, until Brady gets knocked out of the game, not so much.
defense wya
Not what I said. Adjust your playstyle to the refs. 
Defense looking suspect 
"I refuse to believe that Belichick and Patricia are planning on giving Bortles this all day.

A fucking blind man could throw for 300 yards against this defensive scheme."
Lmao idk man as a pats fan they are goood 
This should not be happening. Bortles should not be playing this well, it's as if the Jaguars know what the Patriots defensive calls are beforehand. Hmm....
Fuck Jax is looking good
More like the Pats defense is playing like the Packers
"Pats defense top since week 5!  It's just Bortles!  Jags gave up 40 last week!

lol"
How has our defense reverted back to week 1-4 status? Jesus christ.
Our defense is just terrible at this points. Come on.
for the first 80 yards. yeah. way better in the redzone so far
Your salty tears make us powerful.
That's not true. 
This defense really sucks
Yup but they had to reschedule. 
Yeah, letting Bortles go 11-13 is not the best look.
He will he's known for halftime adjustments. 
Brady was healthy during the Super Bowl last year
I remember that cooks catch from the joint practices. Shit had me hype 
Oh stop it.
I a bold plan to be 2 yards behind the guy you're covering. Let's see if it works out.
Yeah, I get rooting for the underdog, or a close game, but people want the Pat's to lose more than they want the jags to win
Bill Bellichick picked the Jaguars coach, so even if the pats lose they've still won by proxy
Jags actually being aggressive and trying to score tds while the pats are playing so conservative.
Even if JAX goes up 14-3, it's not even halftime yet and still lots of time for Brady to be Brady and Bortles to be Bortles. 
Seems like the Pats schemed to stop Fournette and Bortles is just picking us apart
Man get a stop, please 
Time for a fucking stop
Usually better later in the game. Gave up first score to Titans remember.
This is ridiculos, a fucking cakewalk to our 30
Am I the only one who hates this bortles meme? 
Nope, has all the time atm.
So Bill is responsible for Jax improving?
Pats playing zone... They need to get some pressure on Bottles, if he runs for it the guys in zone should be able to run him down.
UCF aren't the national champions
No calls is helping the jags. Refs in their pockets
wow! Detroit is the only team to never make it to a Superbowl that isn't an expansion team. 
Idk but I would love to find out 
Flats in general are wide open. 
Jags OL is destroying the Pats DL at this point.
PRACTICE-GATE
Our defense is getting WORKED 
It hasn't looked this bad for a while (this season).
It's going to be a long second half. Surprised it's only one penalty so far.
There's no way that Bortles plays this well unless the Jaguars know what the Patriots defensive calls are beforehand. This is a very suspicious game.
worst thing that happened on the app, unusable in threads like this
Jesus Christ get a fucking stop
For-who?
"What are all you snacking on for this game?

I made me some [Asian barbecue pork nachos.](https://i.imgur.com/r4Y0B6B.jpg)"
Lmk when UCF plays teams like Oklahoma or Ohio State every year instead of uconn or Cincinnati lmao
I mean isn't that every game thread?
I don't know why losing to the number 1 defense in the league would be embarrassing. The Jags have been super legit all year 
They better figure out this defense quickly. Sick of the Jags.
Did Romo just call them the Jagwires?
you seem like a good guy. sure, why not? check your pm box. 
Can we launch everyone on this defense into the fucking sun after this game?
jagwires
ayyy weeks 1-4 defense decided to show up
Run defense may as well just not even exist 
Jesus Fournette is playing the ground is lava
They're running right through 
Dammit D quit fucking up
">Who isn't bored of it...

Didn't you say that?

ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”"
What is tackling? 
Fournette is a greasy mother fucker
Or 230. Ya know.
How widely recognized does Bortles need to become before my autocorrect stops correcting it to â€œBottlesâ€?
Oh 65, dancing in the 2nd quarter is just itching for something to happen
lol
Have the Pats rushed more than 3 this entire game? 
Play calling has been impressive so far for jax
Time for Mcdaniels to call the game aggressively and spectacularly only when times are desperate.
This game will be over soon if the Pats keep getting gashed like this. 
What was that?
Jax offensive play calling has been phenomenal
First good play the defense has made yet.
Probably dont want Bortles to hit long passes, and expecting they can eventually get a 3 and out.
God I hope so
Belichick will definitely have some words for the defense at half time. Those words will not be good words.
Isnâ€™t that what people where saying during last seasonâ€™s Super Bowl? 
Damn, can we just complete a fucking tackle today?
Just gets annoying 
Still here?
The Maroney jersey alone should have told you something.
Yes
If these guys could remember they're supposed to defend, it'd be appreciated
Short answer: yes
K.
No Edge holy fuck
Jags  running all over the pats
Colts and Lion fans: These are your future Head Coach's LMAO
I almost envy people who are naive enough to believe Jacksonville realistically has a chance 
did anyone else just see that guy wiggle?
"It's ok, I'm not panicking or anything
"
Please fucking stop here...
Harrison just missed baaaaaaaad
We're looking like we did Weeks 1-5
Game isnâ€™t over until itâ€™s over. Idk wtf is going on right now 
Our defense is looking like they did towards the beginning smh
"Jimmy G ripped apart this defense with worse WRs, worse TEs, worse offensive line.

I got downvoted for this but - I said it right after the trade and I'll say it again. Fucking Pats out of their mind to give up Jimmy G to ride out a 42 year old."
JAX, no doubt 
fuck man getting killed. good shit jags
They donâ€™t even have to pass 
Bend dont break boys, hold em to 3
whAt's a DeFeNSe?
Oh wow, a screen. Glad we finally realized.
Yeesh we are getting gashed down the field 
"> The Pats D is looking terrible

"
Huge fuck up sticking with Brady. He's terrible.
This D-Line is a disgrace
Romo wants the Pats to lose so badly
I'm not going to be happy if this another game the Patriots cannot get a third down. 
THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
Second great play by Van Noy. Please give us a stop.
I wish I had a rich enough vocabulary to properly illustrate just how much I hate our defense.
Did we travel back in time to week 1?
We crapped the bed against the Ravens a few years ago. Probably more than. A few
It hasn't been that bad but it hasn't been pretty. The secondary has generally hid it after the first four games but the talent disparity is clear. 
I really don't like this defense. 
For fucks sake
This is why I hate the bend-donâ€™t-break defense 
This defense still sucks
Fuck
Guys.
That guy is a fucking beast.
Whatever
We're just spotting them a few points right? Right!?
That was like he teleported into the endzone
Yeesh... he just cut straight through there.
Jesus this defense is getting eaten up
Fucking pathetic defense. Absolutely atrocious.
Saved for later
28-3 anyone?  Lol
Defense can show up any time now
Pats really have to at least put 3 up on the board this drive.
I guess I'm glad all of you are happy.
The situation is though. Teams get behind, they make adjustments. How can people on a football reddit not understand that.
Ya, that's our third-down horn.
Jags are calling a great game so far
NE sux. JAX gud. 
We've come back from worse
Don't get too excited guys, we're doing the 28-3 comeback strategy again
Jags putting together the game plan they wanted. Control the clock, run the ball, go up early. Pats have to go answer.
TOMMY SAVE US 
Your D Line
"Pats september defense making an appearance.

But Pats look seriously unprepared. Theyve run the same screenplay 7 times for at least 7 yards"
We are only two more touchdowns away from 28-3 in the third quarter!
Wow we are getting straight up outplayed. Yikes.
Can't tell if Pats are just sucking, or if Jacksonville has elite blocking.
The Jags are utterly dominating the weak ass Pats defense. This team is for real wow
Everything about our defense is trash. Absolute trash. I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if we lost today because of this trash defense. 
Good luck with Patricia Lions 
Fournette is too strong.
Of all the teams that we could lose the Conference game to, I'm not even upset that it's the Jaguars. What a year they've had 
Well, I guess Ill do laundry after all
Damn, it's like the Steelers game all over again.
Defense is afraid of tackling today what the fuck 
Fournette's a fuckin train
YOOOOOO
Lot of game left. 
Patricia could have left before the game if he is that focused
Pats D soft as butter right now 
Plenty of time
Jaguars know what the Patriots defensive plays are. Suspicious. 
All of their RBs are destroying I wish our RBs would do something 
Fuck sake pats
Fornette is a strong boi
Fucking pushed van noy all the way back into the end zone 
Jesus man we look shit....
Did the pats watch any film this week? 
##***BOI***
Half an hour south
Stop tackling high on Fournette.
So this is how it ends huh
We looked worse against the falcons. How can people still doubt this fucking team, its unbelievable to me.
Come on Pats. Hold in there.
I'm hitting the panic button
The beginning of every Patriots game.  Always stressful for us.
Seriously, just stand there, don't get low stand straight up
New England getting bodied. 
Van Noy's entrails are hanging out
Lmao oh Lions I'm so sorry
Fournette running hard af 
As an LSU fan who is also a Patriots fan, I don't know how to feel about Fournette manhandling us right now 
Still not worried.  Only a two score game.  Just need to stop these short passes leading to 20 yards gains.  
Yeah.. Brady can't handle pressure lol
Jax runs the same three plays and the pats defense cant figure out how to stop it
Honestly... might be a good thing Patricia is leaving...
14 min to 8 min possession in favor of the Jags. Ouch.
That's our front 7 though
Just me or has Patricia completely checked out?
Just gotta let the Jaguars score 2 more touchdowns and weâ€™ll be in this game.
The jag-y-ers?
Downvote
Heâ€™s been pretty good for us. 
Yeah, how dare we express doubt that this defense can get the job done. What are we thinking. 
I really wish the Steelers won last week.
Keep going, Jags, /r/nfl is almost there
Patriots don't even seem interested. 
Our defense is so fucking bad 
The Pats are really good at being embarassing. I blame Boston sports media for refusing to entertain the idea that the Pats could ever lose.
What is a tackle?
He is literally the best we got healthy
Matt Patricia spent to much time interviewing and not enough time in the film room
We lost Hightower in Week 3. Lose a defender that important to your defense and we can talk. 
who is tom cougin?
Crying without anything actually happening
Seriously, Bortles hasn't even come close to getting sacked
Our defense blows and we should have kept Jimmy G.
Pat's look completely outmatched, Jacksonville is simply the better team
Could use some Hightower right now
FeelsBadMan
Definitely swallowing the whistles.  But I dig it (except the score). 
Glad to see our coordinators are already looking forward to their new jobs. 
Our defense looks like ass and keeps getting beat on these screens and play actions and not getting much pressure AT ALL.
I love how there are no holding calls
Pats are a second half team....I don't think any Pat's fan is genuinely worried yet 
"""What do you think of your defense's execution today?""

""I'M IN FAVOR OF IT."""
Oh no, we suck again!
Fuck... 
Is Leonard Fournette my dad?
"Pats are done" is not a great statement to make early in the second quarter. 
Can't wait for Patricia to go to Detroit he's so bad
Hope the pats are glad they played conservative early.
If you go look at the sub, it was 7-3
Just standing and watching
Max Kellerman hot take
Then we automatically win, that's just how it works
Hopefully Jacksonville scores another 14 unanswered, for the memes...
How would Jimmy help our defense right now?
Well im definitely upset
Get off the bandwagon
Patricia will be exposed as a moron next year in Detroit. Never impressed by this fuck
Jacksonville just needs to score two more times and weâ€™ll be guaranteed a win.
Guess McDaniels and Patricia are calling it early lmao
Hey John! How's life?
Wtf was that turbotax commercial
Better be ready to play 60 minutes. 
Romo's saying that you're not supposed to run right into that look. Shows how little respect they're giving to our rush D.
Why aren't the refs giving us this game like they always do? Did we forget their bribes today or did the NFL just say "Hey fam, make it look good like the Atlanta game so people think the Pats might lose and we get better ratings." That's gotta be it.
woooooo man we're not looking good at all right now.
I dont think the Pats can get out of a big hole against this defense. They need to score here. 
Can't wait for all of you to be sad after getting your hopes up again
Gtfo
This thread is literally a regurgitation of when the titans were up 7-0 
Yeah I heard him say that too
Wtf? Take that flair off right now if you think that after 1 1/2 quarters. 
Doesn't it say bag the jags
Could take overtime
Seriously. Absolutely flat footed and confused so far
Sike
Damn the Pats D is getting demolished. But hey, atleast our taxes are free!
Well we are fucked
I don't feel like he has a bias. If anything, he's leaning Jags while Nantz is very obviously Pats. 
You're so cute.
Not with a bang, but with a Bortles
The defense doesn't seem prepared for the looks Jacksonville is giving them.  It's still early, we'll see what adjustments are made.  
Honestly this is just all in the trenches. We're losing the game at the line every single snap on both sides of the ball.
He's 7 for 9. Also, he is Brady. I am willing to give him a little time.
I love how people kept telling me the Jags are a bad team.  Even if the Pats come back the Jags are showing they can hang in the playoffs.
Jags playcalling working bit the problem I'd they can't stay the same in the second half. It's still early. 
I'm not. I trust BB and Brady. 
LBs are getting wrecked. Roberts has lost in the hole three times already, Van Noy has been beaten to the edge twice, and Harrison has given up the edge twice as well.
No one gave a fuck about seeing their family in that Chevy commercial 
Fuckin refs arenâ€™t calling anything. Jags O-line and their DBs are holding every play and no calls whatsoever.
Whatâ€™s the Ravenâ€™s score again? Oh, thatâ€™s right. You guys didnâ€™t even make it into the post season. 
Well Falcons blew a 28-3 lead so I ain't tripping. We still have plenty of game left to play.
"Jags are able to run the ball in obvious running situations, not a good sign...


It is my favorite type of football to watch (ala 90's Cowboys). But not sure I want to see it this way..."
Fournette said the NFL was slower than he thought it would be....he might have been serious
I wouldn't count my chickens yet. There was a lot of this sort of sentiment last Super Bowl when the Pats were losing 28-3.
This makes me sad
Because he looks like a pirate king, and is in HC contract talks
Agreed. I think they should make some half time adjustments to STOP Bortles in the second half and to score touchdowns. Optimally multiple. 
"So here's what's going to happen.  Jacksonville is gonna take their foot off the gas pedal and start playing back a little.  They have the Patriots right where they want them.  And then the Patriots will start coming back and they'll be unable to stop them.

Kinda like last SuperBowl."
It's not even half time, guy. I understand though, you must not remember what it's like to have hope you can win past the first quarter
wow that code forearm tat was so hip
You can tell the people in the Chevy commercials are actual people because of how authentic they are being
No we don't. They're giving lots of weird and interesting looks. Half time adjustments are coming and no one is better at them.
Right here! Hi! 
That's why I'm here
Here watching my team play in the AFC Championship game 
JagWIRES -Romo
It's only the Southerners
Like going on fourth down conservative. 
See you all next year, Patriots just don't care about this game.
Weâ€™re losing because the jags offense looks great and our defense is playing like dogshit
Titans don't have Jags D. Also, that's 3 Jags drives in a row where we looked outmatched -- the first one was only stopped on account of two bad throws by Bortles.
I am concerned. I am very concerned.
Nobody likes you 
Off to profit on another tradgey,  bandwagon fan.  
He wouldn't. But Jimmy G looked way fucking better with a worse TE, worse WRs, worse offensive line. Been saying it all year, crazy to put all your chips on a 42 year old.
When they win?
"just getting manhandled right now
"
Hahaha bills were the worst playoff team in the past 20 years lol
That was in response to Brady's ability to keep up
Only if we go down by 20 will I be worried
It's a very small lead for TB12 to over come. Jags need to get a 40pt lead to be safe 
wat
Well, you just jinxed them. Their eventual loss can now be rested in your shoulders.
I'm gonna say it- I hate Patricia's defense and I hate the "Bend- but don't break" mantra of our defense.
Romo is already lying to try to convince people to stay and watch the incoming blowout
Damn but can your salt take away 5 Super Bowls ðŸ¤”
Anyone who thought this would be a cakewalk isnâ€™t a football fan. Jacksonville is legit. This game has nail biter written all over it. 
Whoever told you that never watched a game. This D has looked like this all season.
Ranch. No wonder you root for the Bills thinking blue cheese is better. 
Why doth our defense be trash
This is about as big a lead as i expected the Jaguars to build up, if NE can keep it to here by the half they'll still be plenty in it.
"A turnover for the Pats defense is like finding a needle in a hay stack. 


"
"well shit
"
Good thing New England isn't known for adjusting.
Nothing is that bad
Nah, we're still here. We just don't have much to say when our D doesn't show up to play. We're a second half team, we'll be back loud after the half. 
I do those kicks in madden.  
Jags showing theyâ€™re not pretenders. 
Fucking knew this would happen. Ugh. Lot of game to play but this is just looking very bad for the Pats. 
Let's go! Homer bet Patriots +129. Turn it on Brady!
And a healthy scratch in Alan Branch. 
OMFG there is no "i" and no "y" in Jaguars!
I would like the jags a lot more if this annoying bortles thing didnâ€™t exist
I'm not nervous,  you are 
Iâ€™m confused. I thought Roger Goodall specifically told the refs not to make calls against the patriots /s
"I swear it happens every 3 years. Just a rash of injuries that are plain freaky. 

Jules, Hightower, Cannon, the list goes on. "
I wish Chevy would fire everyone in their marketing department! They make me never want to buy a Chevy...
Do something. Pls
Jahs winning the battle for field position easily.
ðŸ±ðŸ”ª
No plz get them RL Thad Castle :(
If we dont score here were in trouble. 
Colt fans and Lion fans be like: "These are our coaches?"
lol Nantz always sounds shocked when there's no flag against the Jags
"Romo:  Great job covering Gronk

*Shows footage of Gronk being held*

Edit: The replay showed the defensive player holding Gronk's arm.  Im so glad that we have the ""Anti-Patriots"" brigade out in force today.  It leads to great commentary!"
Maybe later
If they don't get points here, I'm going to get nervous. 
Those arenâ€™t throws youâ€™re seeing those are dump off passes
Fucking Christ gronk 
Hope it works for my pats
You were saying? 
There's the big guy!!!
GRONK!
hmmmmmmm
There ya go gronk 
Illegal contact. Textbook.
Lol, it appears that way.
Yes Gronk! Way to get that one back.
Lot of contact there
Probably being a douche somewhere.
Oh thank Gronk for that one
There are a lot of good memers and like a half dozen shit-talking Indy fans in this thread. It's weird.
No pressure on Bortles, no run defense, weak pass defense. This D looks like the first few weeks of the season. :(
damn that throw was scary, landed in the middle of like 5 jags
Apparently he heard you.
so this is going to be one of those Gronk drives I see...
I mean he got hit... I don't know if that qualifies as rocked.
McDaniels and Patricia should be shot for their gameplans so far. If they make me eat my words okay but I think there should be a lot of nervous seats in Detroit and Indy today watching Blake Bortles shred this defense and McDaniels call a draw on 2nd and 10 against a very good front 7
"Maybe passing to one of the greatest TE to play the game could work. Great plan McDaniels! Should give it at least one more try on the second half
"
Are you shitting me? That was DPI
That is said literally every week. 
#HARD
So instead of the defensive players, can we let Gronk kill referees every time he is held or interfered with, and it's not called?
Losing by two possessions to this defense means a lot less playaction, hope the offense can respond 
Fine
Damn nearly had that gronk pass 
You are the first person in this thread to ask about it...
Oof, that was a pop
How dare you root for the team that I'm not rooting for 
Yes! First down!!
I mean, you kinda did for three quarters
The Jags are aggressively cocky and I love it
The Jaguar's dreams of making it to the Superbowl. 
He just has to impose his Force of Will on the Jags.
I highly doubt that
Luckily we're playing Legacy Lands
fuuck
Fuck. 
Welp
I really feared that something like this will happen...
Brady you had all the time..
Yup. This is officially the matchup we all feared it would be.
Brady's gonna get hurt like this.
God Damn. 
Jfc defense is ridiculous
"Brady's hearing footsteps.

The Jaguars have executed almost perfectly so far."
Jags playing a great game so far. Secondary is dominating thus far. 
Holy cow this defense isn't letting up.
Brady, you looked wicked uncomfortable. Flashbacks to the Giants Super Bowls
Jesus....
SWAP BACK THE JIMMY G FOR THE 49ERS SECOND ROUND PICK. WHO SAYS NO
Defense needs to show up
and we're gonna be injured out of the SB
NE is officially in trouble. This shit about to go 21-3
Spring Meadow for sure. At least I'll die in a happy place <3
Jesus Christ, yup, Brady hasn't had this much pressure in a while
"lol our crowd is terrible. 
"
Were toast, Brady is officially spooked
Brady's hand must be jacked up. 
That defense is disgustingly good
I don't think anyone on the cats is dirty,  but you gotta kind of aim for the head when GRONK is upright... 
Don't you know about the longstanding conspiracy by Roger Goodell and the NFL  to support Tom Brady?
You kidding? Romo been doing nothing but complimenting the Jags haha. He's called all 3 of their main coaches basically genius... He's pretty damn impartisl
Usually when you push a reciever out of bounds then you deserve a PI
Itâ€™s 70/30 because people get upset if the pats arenâ€™t completely fucked. Thanks for being sensible about things man.
The only crying is done by you guys any time the Pats get a call, legit or not.
whiny baby
He was pushed out and not allowed back in by the DB to have a shot at the ball
I just want an SO to give it up as much as the Falcons did
Cuz it benefited Patriots.  Could literally take a guyâ€™s head off and people would still bitch about a flag.  Half the people in this thread against the patriots would be giddy if a patriots bus crashed and half the players ended in ICU.
Agreed, they should change the rule to make it 15 yards but the issue is youd always interfere if there was any chance you'd get beat, so there's a downside.
> bending the knee
Because of the PI...
You seem mad. 
Welcome to the dark side
"Yes, flying at the knees and helmet to helmet contact are the only two ways to tackle people. Who knew.

It wasn't some exceptional dirty hit. Unfortunately, this happens all the time. But helmet to helmet when the tackler is in mid air, leading to a concussion on a defender, is basically the textbook definition of an illegal hit. Which is why there was a flag. There really isn't any ambiguity. No one is calling for the defenders head, unfortunately, this is an ugly side of tootball. It probably happens most games. But it's ludicrous to act like that was a good tackle."
Because they favored the Patriots, obviously. What more do you need?
Lol hilarious and originalðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘ŒðŸ¼ you donâ€™t even have a team nice try St. Louis lmaooooooo
Fair
Lol
It was uncatchable because Cooks was out of bounds... because of the PI. Bouye hit him so early the uncatchable part isnâ€™t even relevant anymore.
He was holding Cooks arms down
Yeah I don't think he was targeting but it is the correct call
More like just NE, and refs, if that's what you believe. Everyone else wants the Jags to win lol.
Agreed. Thanks jags, dilly dilly
And people call this /r/Patriots2 smh
The commentators just fuel this shit
Only Way to defend Gronk...  "Nuke him from orbit/Injure him  It's the only way to be sure"
He's 4 inches shorter according to nfl.com
Oh fuck you Boomer.  Hope the fire your ass.
Stop checking out Favres Dick pics and watch the game
"How blatant does a DPI have to be for it to not be the refs rigging the game?

Clearly even when their guy shoves cooks out of bounds taking his chance away at getting the ball, people still think the game is rigged

Apparently an obvious headhunt to try and take gronk out of the game is just ""a good tackle"" as long as the jags do it."
Lol even the analysts are salty.
Judging by the comments in this thread, it kinda seems like they are
Yup. 2 totally legit penalties I might add.
Believe he was bumped/pushed. I doubt he ran OOB just for fun.
It's already toxic
Every* game thread is cancer
Wear your flair then if you're so unbiased
A link to him celebrating while Gronk was wobbling off the field?
I agree on all counts I thought they got the play off
It's actually Alex Guerrero.
LOL did this dude just say, "well it's gillette stadium so the flags have to come out"??? ha ha ha
Saying the refs got those points for pats just sounds like people being sore losers. It was helmet to helmet on gronk, but i admit the dpi was borderline though. Jags playing tough their d is awesome. They match up well against  the pats
Sounds like a bunch of idiots
Because he was pushed out of bounds. 
Mad salty falcons fans here 
"It would have been catchable if he was able to keep running full speed? It was only catchable because he ended up so far behind.

Anyway, they haven't been calling the ""catchable"" part of that penalty for years, which I hate, but it is true."
Finally I see I'm not alone. That foul didn't even look questionable to me, so I don't understand how people are saying it's BS.
this thread is hilarious
Naw not really. If you don't commit penalties they won't be called. Just don't commit penalties *shrug*
Fuck your halftime show BS narrative!
It was definitely delay of game but they should have whistled that dead from the get go
Are you kidding me boomer fuck off
Yea
The problem is that there's such situational variance. Sometimes PI clearly prevents what would have been a catch and TD, in which case even a spot foul is too little. Other times, it's unlikely that the receiver would have caught the ball at all, in which case a spot foul is often much too much. Other times, he probably would have caught it but not gained much yardage, in which case a spot foul is just right.
Why do y'all watch a rigged sport? If you wanna believe its rigged, thats fine, but youre the damn fool for watching a fake sport lololol
Cooks has blazing speed, I don't think it was uncatchable until Bouye pushed him out of bounds. It's more on the fact that once that happened, Cooks couldn't make a legal catch 
So are we sure that Gronk can pass the concussion protocol like ever? 
It was 2 of the most obvious calls I've seen lately. Clear head hunting, and he literally shoved the guy out of bounds with the ball in the air. If anything they went light by not calling that endzone BS. Get your head out of your ass.
"Youâ€™re despicable if you are EVER ok with injuries on ANY player.

What Gronk did in that Bills game was indefensible and reprehensible. 

He doesnâ€™t deserve to get concussed though, and you should feel bad for someone who suffers a serious injury."
Yes
You toss a few people and things get better on their own.
please tell us more
:(
Youre like the fifth reasonable vikings fan Ive seen in this thread. If the pats lose, I'll be pulling for the Vikings.
I was worried my roast duck wouldn't have enough seasoning for a bit
Pats are cheating rhetoric. Ull get used to it. 
Then there's no incentive to not foul when you've been beat more than 15 yards down the field.
How are the Pats fans the triggered ones when the entire rest of the sub are the ones losing their shit at a PI call that gets made every game?
Don't want to risk giving the Pats the ball back. 
Bold statement 
just rewatched it and I was wrong it landed around the 2 yard line but in bounds
Yeah but itâ€™s funny how sad some of these people are. 
Weird I didn't see a ref headbutt gronk....
Completely agree
If he's knocked out I'll be livid
Seriously, the league would be *all over* a Cinderella story like them. People are just desperate for a reason to hate the best, it happens in every sport Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
Classy
And suddenly the loud anti-pats circlejerk thinks egregious helmet to helmet and shove out of bounds arent actually penalties and its all a conspiracy
lol that slow motion facemask on that replay.
Me too. Now we can all watch it spiral downhill into defensive pats fan comments, everyone else saying the pats have bought the league, and people with generic NFL flairs wishing for pats injuries.
and they were getting 1st downs all over us before
Helmet to helmet is litteraly the name of a penalty. If you can't tackle the man legally that is your problem, not something that justifies trying to give him a concussion.
This is sad
But donâ€™t you know anything that happens involving us isnâ€™t football its conspiracy...?
If the refs were on the Pats side, Church wouldn't be in this game anymore. Dirty ass fuck
Hot take.
Oh my god boomer why are you so damn salty. This is a good game between 2 evenly matched teams stfu
Nope, never. They're actually a shit team. You've uncovered the secret.
Tinfoil hats in Patriots threads.
Even Marrone says the helmet to helmet was a good call. The DPI wasnâ€™t as obvious but if you donâ€™t turn around to find the ball more often than not youâ€™re gonna get called. Both consistent calls.
haha that's sooo true omg
If that headshot was on another team people would be calling for Churches head.
That doesn't actually make it any better. He head hunter plain and single. They're throwing punches after the TD, seriously, I haven't really watched them are they always a dirty team like today?
I know this game is going to turn around. Jaguars could've tried to score there, but they didn't. They scared of us.
The refs called the penalties that happened. You're just salty. 
Maybe instead of getting mad at one team have faith in your team to not lose the lead?
if newton didn't get pulled there's no way gronk's getting pulled
No, stop.
Shoulder to shoulder isnâ€™t a penalty. Helmet to helmet is. Helmets go on heads, not shoulders. I know itâ€™s easy to mix them up.
no its clearly the refs going after the Jags
How can we hold any one when our DB arenâ€™t anywhere near the receivers?
Tommy is giving Gronk the water, he will be just fine.
Bye! Glad you hate legitimate penalties
Agreed. That naturally leads to slightly more penalties, but doesn't make them dirty.
He drove Cooks out of bounds...
â€œRefs made Brady the best QB in historyâ€
Just crying like a bunch of babies. That was such blatant pass interference. If it was their team they'd change their tune. 
Yeah why try to score twice instead of once 
Stay classy Buffalo.
Holy fuck this is an angry thread. I hope we can get along JAX bros
PATS PAID OFF THE COACH GUIZZZZ
lol sure bud
Then you get DBs mugging receivers downfield when they know theyâ€™ve been beaten
Want a tin foil hat? I can sell you one.
thanks I'm glad you see it that way
Yeah, I don't know who that was mauling White after he got the touchdown...
"RIGGEDDDDDD!
"
I said the same thing
Anything that helps the Pats is BS. Anything that hurts the Pats is the right call.
"""how do you stop gronk""

Apparently you go helmet to helmet on him "
Helmet to helmet has never been allowed for anyone.
Yes
I stand corrected!
good game
Don't want to risk a turnover and give the Pats more points before half. 
Hey guys, WHAT ABOUT BRADY'S HAND!? More on this at halftime!
this thread is ~~hilarious~~ fucking cancerous
Ive seen a steelers fan and seahawks and Packers fan in the last ten comments saying they're good penalties
You're the one who doesn't seem to understand football.
he sure is!! 
Undisciplined defense is not a rig guys 
lol!
Ok well those should always be flags.  They been called in other games this year too.
Sooo those calls were incorrect? 
Maybe it seems like you see it more with the Pats because they have more prime time games than anyone else.
Because the Patriots are benefiting from a penalty. That's all it is. 
I don't have the replay to watch again but to me it looked like the helmets hit first but it might now have. Either way that is going to be a penalty regardless of who is playing. 
Shhhhh don't be rational. 
Plot twist: Gronk becomes extremely intelligent after being knocked in the head. An issue with buildups blocking neuron transmissions has now been fixed, and a new and improved Gronkowski walks back onto the field.
I prefer his mental health to winning this game, but why not both? Gronk rests and Pats win.
We won our past two Super Bowls without any of those. Flair up.
"This was well after there were flags down in the field and he knew the pats were getting 15 yards out of it.  So do you think he was celebrating the fact that the patriots were getting 15 yards, or that he knocked the patriots best offensive weapon out of the game?

And you clearly see his helmet hitting gronks on the replay.  "
Had Cooks run the Flacco dpi special route
That's fair, I think it's debatable maybe defensive holding would have been more appropriate.
omg so funny stop making me LOL
You can't say that, it goes against their narrative
You're blind. You can't hold someone and run them off the field. 
It happens every pats thread when the game is somewhat close.  
Ok lets take him a hammer to his head then. 
Gronk take my brain
I didn't notice it until after the play, but judging by the reaction of the commentators it must have been pretty close.
Here's hoping you get banned from the sub.  Go back to watching replays of your rapist qb, chump. 
Can Gronk pull a Wilson and just come back in and not get punished
I canâ€™t believe people are defending the helmet to helmet hit saying itâ€™s not a penalty 
Like tackling someone 5 yards in the end zone?
I mean any thread involving the Pats eventually devolves into a shit show of "refs helping the Pats" 
Yeah, I don't think it's dirty. They're aggressive, playing to the edge, but not dirty. If the refs dont call it, then you take advantage of it.
Youâ€™re right. Because the rules donâ€™t prevent a runner from initiating helmet to helmet contact. If you wanna change that for player safety, go for it, but pretending this is a bias thing is fucking stupid.
Yeah cause the plan was to injure gronk... See "Saints"
I think it's too late
Stay classy bandwagon fan.
I hate players strutting around after every hit and it every jags player today.
Yes. He clearly pushed him out while ball is in the air. You can stand your ground and guide him out. You canâ€™t extend your hands and push him out. PI 10 times out of 10.
Everyone's happy until the Pats score. Simple as that. 
Maybe if the Jags D didn't go head hunting the second Brady figured out how to get Gronk involved in the passing game.
Thanks. Also, 5 rings. (Had to fit it in somewhere)
Jags brought it in the first half, but can they bring it for a full 60?
They are scared of giving the ball back to the Pats and they have the ball coming out of the locker room. 
He hit him in the fucking helmet. Thats not what people mean when they want people to hit him up high.
That dirty hit may keep Gronk out the whole game so, it may be worth it
We're about action New England.
They hate Gronk because of Buffalo. Even saw a comment wishing injury, with up votes! Do that to any other player on any other team & you get ran out of r/NFL
They're trying to reduce concussions, hence stopping head to head hits.
They do
Salty Steelers flair? Who would have guessed 
Are you sure? Scroll down and youâ€™ll see fans defending it 
Probably targeted him.
I will focus more on how Church pransed around Gronk on the ground shaking his towel and then cheering as Gronk was taken into the locker room. Dude was thrilled to possibly injure another player. 
I wish I could trash talk in your championship game but... yeah your team blows. 
Which call exactly do you think was wrong, the Helmet to helmet, or the obvious pass interference?
Phil Simms sucks
i can say the same for the pats haters. those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
He railroaded him out of bounds like it was a punt return, I mean wtf "weak call"? YOU CAN'T TOUCH HIM
Yes? You can't contact and push a WR out of bounds when the ball isn't in play. Have you seen a football game before?
Can we just take a moment to admit how fine Tori Kelly was in that Nation Wide commerical?
My favorite potato chips are salt and winegar
Except for the 4 jags fans in this thread. 
Yes, when the receiver can't make it back onto the field he might be interfered with. Running out of bounds under your own power is against the rules, even.
It's just such a bad look. There's no way that wasn't intentional. What a prick.
Its more of the fact Cooks was pushed out of bounds and the second that happens, he can't make a legal catch even if he got around Bouye. If that is allowed, than every corner is gonna start doing that and just cause illegal catches by players going out of bounds
It's always fun reading some of these conspiracy theories. They get quite creative.
That was the most obvious helmet to helmet I've ever seen. Should have been an ejection.
The clock was at 0. Head-to-head isn't "marginal". He shoved the receiver out of bounds before the ball got there and made it literally impossible for him to make a play on the ball. What the hell are you talking about?
"> Again, i didn't lose.

Are you a Falcons fan from a developing nation?

I was wearing my Super Bowl LI champion hat today.  It says ""Patriots"" on it.

You know the Falcons lost, right?

ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”"
Wouldn't he have been able to catch it if he were able to keep running?
You mean helmet to helmet isnâ€™t obvious?
[Reading all the comments complaining about the fair penalties](https://youtu.be/yKIuj4n_8PQ)
I have no idea how anyone could disagree with it. It couldn't be any clearer 
oo jets fans still exist ??
Doubt it. Concussion protocol is inconsistent and means squat, I'd be surprised if they held him out
This first drive for the jags in the 2nd half is going to be suuuuper important
"True, I couldn't tell when it looks like they are playing normal football.

Think the refs are going to fuck up your obvious win any more?

EDIT: Just a casual talk, nothing more."
Maybe but I'll take boner too
It wasn't catchable because of the PI. Kept him from getting to the ball.
Benjamin Watson, we love you
This thread is now a [NO PATRIOTS ZONE] Patriots flairs enter at your own risk.
That would be hilarious but I'd be afraid of the hubris coming back to bite us
Fuck off man.  Get out of our fandom with that shit.
Greg Olsen is awesome, he deserves that award
"If helmet to helmet leads to a guy leaving with concussion the defender should have to leave too.

That'd be one way to get headshots out of the game (somewhat)"
We associate the hated call with the hate for our team. No ever seems to say "right call" when it's in our favor
pushed out can reenter.
Every pats game thread is toxic lol
He couldn't run back in bounds. Was basically pushed out of bounds 
Cooks contact was the to knock Bouye's hand off his chest. Bouye ran into Cooks.
It's a judgement call yes.  Did the PI make the pass uncatchable or was it uncatchable regardless
Isnâ€™t /r/nfl supposed to be /r/patriots2?
Yeah forcing a WR out of bounds is contact past the line of scrimmage and stops him from making a play on the ball... that makes it PI. Drink less bleach and you understand that.
Oh well if he was mad at Gronk, then that's fine. 
ha i caught that too
JJ Watt is a class act
Steelers and losing to the Pats/Jags
jj watt's winning this
Watch his pupils while showing him the number 69
The only similarities between the 2015 broncos and the jags is the headhunting
Maybe the Jags should stop committing blatant penalties then.
Both sides of the ball gotta be more aggressive if we wanna win this 
It was catchable if he wasnâ€™t mauled for five minutes. There was plenty of time to get there without the PI.
Kind of like how Wilson didn't even sit on the bench long enough for them to pull the blue tent up before he grabbed his helmet and ran back on the field? 
I think it's a good call but people are calling it intentional and dirty which I don't think it was. Difference.
Literally anywhere but the helmet
Are you fucking stupid? Those two penalties were as obvious as they get 
Ok bud. Enjoy the delusion. 
The helmets hit. That is helmet to helmet. Regardless of who is playing that is going to be a penalty 100% of the time.
Yeah, but the play should have been called sooner
Yeah but they shouldn't be throwing flags on them! That's favoritism!
FOH
Amazing how every single teams fan is so biased they think every call for the pats is BS
Yup, and they're the majority of the sub. They're scum
You can see bouye has an extended arm and isn't letting him back in bounds. You can't do that. If he's OB you can't do that, and if he's in bounds you can't really do that. It's textbook. 
The best part is you really didn't have to be specific 
What would you expect from a Brady-stan like Jaguars HC Doug Marrone.
To be a good football team you must prepare for everything, even the refs. Sorry all you other teams don't take care of them like we do. #ELOE
You support a team who literally got the rules changed evasive they couldnâ€™t win otherwise. Cry more.
And yet when they go the other way and everyone whines it's fine?
So were the people last week shitting on them before the Pats pulled ahead. Only took them 28 points last week
How is everyone salty about the PI when that Jags safety prob just took Gronk out of the game on a cheap shot?
"Only if people will stop saying every call that goes our way is bullshit. 

Especially in cases like this where they were obvious calls. 

The only questionable one was the Delay of Game. And I think they got the play off"
I couldn't agree more
agree
I don't know... don't lead with your head?
....by calling blatant PI and roughness? Gimme a break.
I think the hit on Gronk was clearly a penalty but I don't think it was intentional or dirty. Woahhh look at that guys. A middle ground!
I also saw him punch(sorta?) Lewis on the ground after a tackle, too, lol
so repeatedly making contact and pushing a WR after 5 yards is not a penalty to you? got it.
Or maybe... just maybe... he doesnâ€™t have a concussion?
It's cool when you say it because you're a Jags fan. Thanks.
A defender driving his head into the facemask of a defenseless receiver is a no-call? Their own coach said it was a good call. 
If he didnt hold cooks, that ball was catchable
We're in a game with the Pats playing. It's the nature of the beast a lot of the time. I just want to see an injury free second half at this point.
Which was also the right call.
seriously, they should have been flagged 3 straight plays earlier in the game and nothing, then a blatant headhunting and shoving a guy out of bounds and suddenly "BUT MUUHHH REFFSSSS"
Can you rate them also?
y'all are gonna lose today. SKOL
I mean that's half true. You don't want to have to try and make a comeback without your best offensive player. 
Nah, then it just becomes NewtonGate II
Really though? A direct head-on hit and a corner shoving the WR out of bounds? Bull shit penalties? Maybe your team should tighten things up a bit and not take stupid penalties
We finished with the same record...
Take the lead into the half, why risk a pick or fumble that puts the Pats right back into it.
No way man. It's the Patriots therefore no penalty is legit and they cheat on every single play. 
">Helmet to helmet legit call. Pass interference was garbage. Dude ~~ran~~ was pushed out of bounds. 

FTFY"
nice. 
Yayyy. Another toxic game thread. 
thats the only way you can beat the patriots I guess
Really? That helmet to helmet isnâ€™t going to be called?
"Have always wondered the same â€” maybe they can be more aggressive because the negative outcomes don't come out as much. If they punt or turn the ball over with little time on the clock, it leaves the other team with a worse chance to score?

I'm really not sure "
no way it's worse than the AFC south. also two of Brady's titles was top 5 strength of schedule including number one in 2004.
They're obvious calls lmao ok 
don't be a dick, dick
Pass interference should be a spot penalty because otherwise it'd be more beneficial to just illegally impede receivers on every well-thrown deep pass.
Bills will not make the playoffs next year and jags will be back to a 5 win team at best. Can't wait. 
because anytime one call happens in our favor the universe brings out the pitchforks. 
The ball landed inbounds close by...
I think there is some cognitive bias there.
What interview did you listen to? He said â€œI donâ€™t know about the other oneâ€. Thatâ€™s him calling the DPI bullshit? 
"DPI wasn't questionable,
He held him back for like 10 yards then shoved him out of bounds"
Salty tears taste somehow taste so sweet 
Literally everyone else is bitching too. The amount of â€œ riggedâ€ comments are asinine 
But if this happens on an other match, "the refs just sucks". If it happens on a Pats match, "the refs are with the Pats"...
Because if they get a touchdown, being up by 3 is much better than 2. This isn't the end of the game. You don't give up free points. 
No itâ€™s not ðŸ™ƒ
You're acting like the NFL is doctoring the game but if you watched all of the Jags penalties were egregious as fuck
I get this entire subreddit despises the Patriots for inexplicable reasons, but where are all these termites coming from claiming a helmet to helmet hit being called is "clearly the refs being paid off"?
Thats...actually not unreasonable. Similar to the college rules.
heh  good one
Are we really tryna say the calls weren't legit tho?
Saints DNP
Our fan base may whine, but the other 31 in our game day threads whine more about the reffing conspiracy
I believe it was because he was pushed out
Don't chase points. If you don't get the 2 point conversion then you might be chasing that extra point the rest of the game. 
football snowflakes .
Except that's not true at all.
Because thereâ€™s 30 mins left and 4 points is a relevant difference versus 5 still 
He straight up pushed him out of bounds
"Hahaha every down vote is a dozen salty years shed.

"
sotrueman
Yeah that makes it ok to go helmet to helmet 
I wish more fans could be like this. Like Jesus Christ this thread has become total cancer.
The new shit is the same as the old shit anyway. It's just a bunch of people saying the refs are paid by the Pats/the game is rigged. 
Welcome to everyone hates us, featuring most of /r/NFL
Yeah.. I wasn't paying full attention after but it looked like he kicked him. I bet it was camera angle trickery.
THey're doing that too, which is almost as bad
Jags.
Ball was in the air.
I can't say I'm proud of that sentence, not my best work. I meant the players lol.  The fans are obnoxious but that's any fanbase, Pats fans are just as bad
If He's not making a play on the ball, yes.
Thread lag is just crazy. This is a bloody battle 
#metoo
#T O M B R A D Y I S T H E G R E A T E S T Q B O F A L L T I M E 
Eye for an eye type punishments are stupid
If you came to a thread like this for humility you've come to the wrong place. 
Why (other than because it benefitted the Patriots)?
Couldn't been Pats 21 to 7 but refs missed huge PI call, smh
So true on that last point. Gotta at least try to get in field goal range to make it a 7 point game.
"â€œ(e) Cutting off the path of a receiver by making contact with him without playing the ball.â€

http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/passinterference"
This has to be a joke
lol
It's us. Just let it be.
Sounds like his usual pregame ritual. 
too bad the Jags play dirty
But the refs!
"Check the downvotes and the thread. 

There's a reason there's a ""complex"""
So you are admitting it was the correct call then. Nice.
i say 99% he'll be back. newton was falling over and they let him back. 
Iâ€™m all for talking shit, but it isnâ€™t a one way street. Just because we are pats fans doesnâ€™t mean we have to take it and not say anything back.
As a fellow fan of poultry and civil discussion, I wholeheartedly agree
"Here is it

https://streamable.com/xs2c3"
And we all know he isnâ€™t missing the second half, its the playoffs and the protocol is a joke, heâ€™ll be back and probably catch 60 yards and a score
"Happy ref after Pats TD

https://streamable.com/xs2c3"
"""Justice for Tre'Davious"" 

-Bills fan in this thread"
If he's concussed he needs to sit. I doubt he does regardless though :(
Bruh it was a delay of game. 
Eagles fan with a Redskins flair...
"Like I said I could see it going both ways. It was great coverage by Bouye but then at the end he gets too physical with Cooks to make sure he is out of bounds. I hate the PI rule and think it should be 15 yards max, that doesn't warrant a 30+ yard penalty.

Because of this I don't think it should have been called, but I see why it was"
A concussion would be the least of his concerns at that point. Seems like a solid strategy
What a surprise, some moron saying any call that helps the Pats is false no matter how clearly it isn't
It was in favor of the pats tho, so refs rigged the game
"> Jags aren't dirty 

Their player threw our rb to the ground in the end zone and then proceeded to talk about to him. If they're not dirty, they're not mature"
Patriots game threads in this sub are awful.
"Every team has won games off refs.

Jags committing penalties isn't the Pats or refs fault. The blame for those flags are squarely on the Jags players."
I see you haven't read a single comment in this thread not from a Pats flair. Literally everyone is crying rigged by the refs. 
I think itâ€™s the other way around?
Does no one else think it looks line Bouye pushed him ob? You can't push a reciever with your hands, you can only try to angle him out. Cooks might have gotten to the ball without the push too, which makes it catchable if the official deems he could have gotten close.
Didnâ€™t know a PI bothers people more than the Jags safety cheap shotting our best weapon and taking him out of the game
"Word PI call was iffy everything else was spot on. Don't understand what most of these comments are getting at.
"
People are bitching about the delay of game as well, when it was clearly a delay of game. Any penalty that goes against the opponent of the Pats is evidence of the game being rigged.
Jaguars youâ€™ll pay for that gronk hit.
Which is why I want to see what happens  if Fournette gets hit helmet-to-helmet and see how many people are hypocrites.
Both of those penalties would have been called regardless of the two teams playing
Settle down now.
Maybe because everyone's saying the refs are giving us the game for legit fucking penties
Gronk didn't hurt anyone(thankfully), apologized and got suspended. it's time to get over it. 
They are more disciplined?
He pushed him OOB. It was clear as day.
Fuck off, salty bitch
Itâ€™s almost like one of the teams playing is known for being disciplined.
Wish Brady was playing against our D. That's for sure. 
Because he just got hit in the head by a 218 pound superhuman? 
No, no. The patriots are cheating and the refs are in on it. Or something 
Wait are people really suggesting that this game is evidence of biased officiating?
Come to the dark side brother
We're giving you McDaniels....but sure nobody cares about the Patriots.
It's a bang bang play, I don't like how he seemed happy about it afterwards though
This is less than tasteful
Classy 
Penalties looked pretty straight forward to me. Not sure what the hysteria is about. And people saying the Gronk hit was totally okay need to get their eyes checked. 
Don't expect jags fans to be intelligent 
Since when is PI a conservative call though? How many times has Rodgers of Flacco thrown it up to be awarded with a flag? I would like to see it go back to a tiered penalty, but they wanted to take the sujective judgment out of the ref's hands.
Let's go 3 and out.
This game is unwatchable, literally unwatchable, we have a tornado watch so the wind keeps knocking out my signal rip. 
Honestly I'm outta this game thread. This is the worst I've ever seen /r/NFL. You all need to go to a therapist and get yourselves checked out, because it just ain't healthy to be so wrapped up in your hatred for a team that you would deny obvious observable objective reality.
Yes, catchable means "catchable if the penalty wasn't committed" not "catchable while getting interfered with".
We need a second half thread. Idk why NFL mods do this. CFB does big game threads right. Break it by half, or quarter, if you have to. 
Jaguars
I'm inclined to agree with you, but it's pretty obvious that the majority of the sub hates the Patriots. And it doesn't help when every other comment is about refball
it was like 1 second over
Well, that IS his default setting.
you guys are dumb as fuck
Whats a "tuck rule"?
Lol literally? Don't think I caught that, but it sounds like you are literally using the word literally wrong. 
its amazing how many people are gleeful about a brain injury right now and getting upvotes.
"For the most part the Pats don't play dirty... Yep Gronk was dirty against buffalo... Bill has punished him, lucky he got a 2nd chance most pats don't.. they end up traded to the raiders or Cleveland.. 

Edit:  /oh crud wrong reply...   resume bashing all is good..."
Are you stupid or do you just like acting like an idiot? How can gronk push the db down when his back is to him when he goes down? Legit didn't do shut to him
More like triggered 31 other teams fans. Those were 100% the correct call
When the receiver is held up and pushed out of bounds.. how can you say it wasn't catchable? Without those actions he gets to the spot
He only pushed him out of bounds... 
Lmao delete this
Pushing receiver out of bounds isnâ€™t PI anymore?
Recent history would indicate yes. 
Cheering for Phily in the next game, because I want the AFC to win no matter what. 
The influx of comments is probably overloading the servers a bit.
Gronk was also up in the air making a catch. Church was headhunting and had to try pretty hard to succeed. Fuck him
Helmet to helmet = refs rigging the game.
It was White, not Lewis. But yeah, he was punched 
id give you the number for my optometrist but i doubt your ass could read it
Prepare to be downvoted, take my upvote in defense
He shoved Cooks out of bounds.
Idk man, /r/NFL seems like they are 
He was getting shoved out by Bouye, itâ€™s catchable if heâ€™s able to run his lane without the interference. Iâ€™m probably biased, but I really felt that was the right call objectively. If it was reversed Iâ€™d probably be pissed at whatever pats player that was for being so stupid. 
Yeah you don't know how that rule works
Hit him in the body
Losing must feel great by now for a Browns fan
"Hahaha 

Just commenting so I get back here in 90 mins"
Can they put quotes around the word celebrity? 
Brady is playing phenomenal, not sure what you're talking about. Bortles is dumping the ball off and blocking is why the Jags are moving the ball. 
Meant to say "every" not yeah - but yep people just incredibly biased looking for something to blame
so you can just push a WR out of bounds mid route?
Please provide proof that we're cheating. Fuck off. Bad calls happen all the time.
"> Consistent track record of getting caught for cheating aside

Where did they get caught cheating aside from Spygate, which was 10 years ago and not even a big deal?

>unbiased people who watch the game can see the significant help the patriots get from favorable calls. 

Calling a penalty on a helmet to helmet hit is... a favorable call? Guess they should just stop calling false starts then too. 
"
You guys think the reffing is bad, then maybe have your team take all this after the play extracurricular out of it first. 
The callousness of this sub is incredible. 
It's easy to forget and ignore the calls that don't support your narrative. 
I could maybe buy that if he didn't start celebrating afterwards like he was some big tough guy.
What? Cooks was pushed out of bounds. That's blatant.
Commercial break...cuts back to the game just to tell us that there's another commercial break. Thanks NFL
Romo said it was PI...
The announcers right after the replay: "theyre gonna call that everytime" 
Well itâ€™s 14-10 so...
any word on gronk?
Guys, who takes Malcolm Butler in FA?
Gronk did that in response to everyone diving at his knees and his head. He's sick of people trying to hurt him so he whacked the guy in anger.  
lmao
Why are people accusing the refs? Do people actually think that the refs are trying to swing the game in the Patriot's favor? Referees are objective, and call the game as they see it.
Pretty evident from the 'tackle' made on James White, about 5 yards after he ran into the end zone
This guy
:(
He was clearly held and pushed out of bounds. Thats not a hometown call.
Lol they now imagine if the jags got those calls in their favor. No one would bat an eye. Bunch of lousy NFL fans ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
37 years old 
When CB's initiate the contact, the calls usually go against them, even if a WR hand fights back. This is pretty common. And the Gronk one was as blatant as can be.
Disagree that Pats should respond by targeting. But I think your other idea is interesting -- the offending player sitting while concussion protocol is going on, and being out if the player ends up being concussed. I'd have to think about the implications of that a little more. On the surface it seems like a more reasonable version of the "targeting" rule in college, where a hit can get a defender kicked out of a game even if it doesn't result in a concussion of the opposing player.
The reason that bouye got pi was because he kept using his hands on cooks. If they were on the infield it would be fine but on the side line your bumping on the wr can't push them out of bounds. If he stopped with the hands and just controlled the space with his body it would have been fine
Keep hating bitches.
I told friends that the Jags should be favored for this game. I wouldn't bet against them. And up till that last drive, I'd root for them if they made it to the SB. But fuck that now 
the best threads are where every new post starts at 0 points
"OP said:

>The refs are gonna make sure the Pats keep getting breaks

The implication being that the refs did something out of the ordinary in that circumstance which shouldn't normally happen, and which benefitted the Patriots"
both announcers called both plays good calls.
Right, the NFL is involved in a huge conspiracy to benefit the Patriots, which is why they suspended Brady for four games despite high school physics proving his innocence. Take off the tinfoil bro.
With no regrets?
"hard to tell because he pushed Cooks out of bounds. I think that was called DPI for that reason.

I personally thought they missed a pretty clear DPI on whoever jumped through Hogan on a 3rd and 11 to knock down the ball. Calls have generally seemed good this game though."
Literally all I see is this thread is people talking shit about the Pats. Are we reading the same comments?
Good call.  I'm thinking the same.  
The Gronk hit was absolutely not the right call, it should have been an immediate ejection. 
"Lol, if you're gonna believe half the commenters here, then yup!

Or acknowledge that refs are imperfect and probably not favoring either team..."
How was the delay of game bullshit? Not really a subjective rule.
I think youâ€™re channeling youâ€™re own rapeyness
The guy was fucking celebrating after the hit. It was dirty.
"The defender hit Gronk helmet to helmet. Thereâ€™s literally nothing else to it than that. Gronk is allowed to do whatever he wants, never mind the fact he barely started to look downfield.

Itâ€™s black and white. You hit a guy in the helmet whoâ€™s catching a pass you get a penalty."
It benefitted the patriots. What do you expect?
Dpi was questionable but don't pit yourself in the position to make the ref make a decision.  Fournette is a beast.  I'm terrified of him :(
People that think those were good calls: Doug Marrone.
I didnâ€™t 
Ah, because we don't agree with those who say the refs gifted them?
You mean the ref breaking up the fight while smiling? Yeah proof of a fix. You're fucking insane.
It's true people just want to see the Pats lose. 
This exactly.  But every single non-Pats fan here is cheering because they know its the only way they can win.  It usually backfires though.  It will be the spark we need.
Also reads: â€œjags committing penalties on a 5:1 ratio compared to pats.â€ 
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion no matter how god damn stupid. 
They will be playing frisbee in the second half
I'm a fan who likes the shiny flair. Why you joking about suicide? I mean I guess you could after you shitshow of a season
Notice everyone who wants the Pats to lose are always blaming the refs? It's a pattern.
And they have been a point of emphasis AND penalties for the last couple of seasons. It's okay if you've missed it, now you know
Hi
"That entire desk has done the same thing all year.

It's good to see that they are at least consistent in their butthurt."
haha, that's awesome
He also loves the pats. Apparently
Ok then.
Gronk got up a bit wobbly. Church got up celebrating
Well so far they've only gotten flagged on 1 of their dirty plays.  No flag on tackling White to the ground 5 yards in, also one of the times Brady really got hit hard I was half-expecting a flag
You mean after the Pats player got thrown down 5 yards into the endzone? Sure. 
Don't bother bud. Downvote army is pretty active today. Anyone with NE flair is getting down voted
Agreed. Not dirty, but definitely a penalty.
If it ain't broke (ratings wise)
You donâ€™t win 15 division titles, 7 conference championships, and 5 Super Bowls without the refs help.
Seriously, guy should have been tossed, swing at his face
Celebrating after the hit and walking on top of a player you tried hurting is pretty churlish.
Risks a fumble and Pats recovery basically already in field goal range 
Honestly I think helmet on helmet hits don't come with a big enough penalty. Just because Gronk is huge people are discounting it. Imagine the same hit on a wr. He's a defenceless receiver. 
Yes it has to be catchable, but if the DB is held and it is THEN uncatchable it can be called.
Can't believe #refball made the Jags kneel with 55 seconds left and a timeout. 
Good offenses tend to draw penalties
Nope. 
This sub's stupidity blows my mind sometimes. 
Uncarchablw because of the pi
Pretty much standard for a Pats playoff game.
But you're wrong. Pats fans were not ok with that hit. Don't be stupid.
He cut off the route Cooks was running. 
Jags
Gronk is tall, so somehow that makes it ok. 
Hit him anywhere but the head and don't blatantly try to take out his knees and you won't hear complaints from anyone
Classy
Presumably the whiplash of the head hitting the ground as well. I don't know for sure though.
Gain marketing team right here.  
"Wow, /r/HailCorporate 

/s"
Its for the box people who might want to come out of the box. 
They don't want to take the risk while still in the lead, but I agree with you. Jags could still have possibly managed another TD drive. It was at like :54 still
You're the one who thinks the Falcons won Super Bowl 51.
"We got a couple debatable calls (roughly since the Pittsburgh game) and now there's a brigade of trolls that yells rigged as soon as the Pats get any call and it makes the game threads super shitty every time.

Admittedly there was a bad call on a Bills TD week 16 and the Tennessee game but they do it on everything."
Thereâ€™s going to be so many penalties against the jags in the second half. I love mentally soft opponents
Had Cooks not been held he couldâ€™ve caught the pass, it landed 3 yards in front of him. 
Hey bby 
You're right. I shouldn't stoop to your level. Based on your comments, you just irrationally hate the Patriots. No point in wasting the energy here.
Last weeks titans pats was just as bad 
It's Gillette so the flags have to come out.  All of them were obvious.
But then theyâ€™ll have to come up with another joke to run into the ground for the next year
Jags are playing some seriously hard hitting football and I love it.  Only two things I would say was excessive is that helmet to helmet and that throw and the aggressive tackle to the ground 5 yards in the end zone.  The helmet-to-helmet looked egregious and brutal.
Thanks, tornadoes don't usually start this early in the year but Texas isn't known for its stable weather lol. 
Lol, we're probably in for a loss if they do.
But why would they? What's the benefit in there for them? Wouldn't the NFL want more diverse winners? Showing that the NFL is a competitive league where everyone can win the Super Bowl if doing it right. Having the Pats win it every other year makes people think that there's no reason to watch it...
Lmao. Literally being assaulted with all sorts of garbage comments and the Pats fans are the problem. 
"That was what confused me the most. I get that the tackle made Gronk drop the balls, but the ref was calling the flag and Church was still getting congratulations while Gronk was literally staggering out of bounds.

It seems risky to act like that right after a penalty call, especially one that has to do with concussion protocol."
Why not go to the bills game day thread 
Wasn't a punch, more of a shove after the play ended. Could have been called for unsportsmanlike, but I don't mind the refs not calling it because it wasn't too egregious.
He ran him out of bounds, thatâ€™s where the call came from. 
When did the NFL having a fix in for the Pats start? Last year it was all about how much they hate each other. 
Aren't these the same analysts that admit they don't know the catch rules? Just saying, they aren't always the most reliable source.
Gimme ur cheese
Gronk is massive. Lower your shoulder and hit his waist. There is no excuse for launching high and into his head. And then celebrating the fact afterwards 
Yes they do.  People complain about bad reffing every game.
Lol thank you for the laugh :D
"Takeaways from this game so far, as impartial as possible.

Jaguars ability to mix up their plays and confuse the Pats defence is beautiful.

Jags players are fired up, maybe a little too much. Playing dirty rn.

Gronkowski could come back, no one on this sub truly knows how well or poorly he'll come off.

Game is entertaining af. "
Usually the one who delivers the hit is prepared and doesn't get hurt. Also, Gronk was wobbly while Church was already debating with the ref, no signs of a concussion
Your logic is blatantly inconsistent. All the people questioning the refs are right because there are many of them while all the people supporting the refs are wrong even though there are many of them, too (not to mention the actual, official referees)?
Jags
I cant wait to watch the qbs throw fireballs at the pro bowl.
Jags
Gronk status please
Itâ€™s inevitable when the opposing teamâ€™s safety cheap shots your best offensive weapon and takes him out of the game, but everyone cares more about the bad PI call
If you can't beat them, ref them.
Incidental head to head is still a flag, but there's no way he meant to. do that . Its a fast game, play on
"> Lol, inexplicable.... You know how Red Sox fans hate the Yankees? You guys are the mother fucking Yankees of the NFL.

The Yankees bought most of their wins because they're the richest team in the baseball league. 

That, and it's a cultural thing between the two teams. No one else hates the Yankees. So, bad example. 

"
"Who buys the Ford F150!?

It looks like a bland box with wheels. Something a child would design."
He wasn't "bodied" out of bounds, the defender's hands were all over him. He was pushed. It's blatant pi. You can't touch them like that after 5 yards. 
...you alright, man?
yep he was..
I think it was more the extra tackle on the touchdown that bothered some peeps
"â€œWhatâ€™s your favorite number, Gronk?â€

â€œ69 heheheâ€

â€œ...Heâ€™s good to go.â€"
the chiefs and home playoff losses.
STFU you are fucking blind.
If pushed out by a player through illegal touching, or defensive interference, they have to step back in and are eligible receivers. He did not step out in his own. Thatâ€™s why it was dpi. 
One team committing more penalties doesn't equal a fix
I want no huddle and I want it now.
Lmao oh shit 
yes
But but... The NFL already planned who's playing in the Superbowl and it's all rigged. But I'm still going to watch every game on my direct TV and complain about how the fix is in. 
He went for a big hit and wasn't looking at where he was hitting. IF you do that you'll wind up hitting high sometimes. Also, he went a bit high to begin with, hitting Gronk in the head is not all that easy to do, he's like 6'6 and Church is 6'2, not exactly hard to hit him in the torso if you're just running straight at him.
Ahh, that makes more sense, thank you. 
Hope gronk is ok
Ever see "Mahk" do his take on those?
It's illegal to push a receiver out of bounds. Sorry bro
Just football.
I can't wait for Stardew's multiplayer update 
Those penalties were as blatant as it is possible to be.
Yes.
Yes.
Excuse me r/nfl, do you have the time to speak about our lord and savior jesus christ?
It has nothing to do with the Patriots though. The nfl is a joke when it comes to concussions. There's been so many instances of either guys coming back when they shouldn't have or not even bring evaluated when warranted. 
Heâ€™s still big with teens and is in a serious relationship with Ariana Grande last I checked 
Just enjoy it like wrestling fans do then.  Nobody seems to mind if the WWE is rigged.
Jumped?  you are delusional.
Saved so I can potentially put this in the post game thread
Pretty much. Welcome to the fun.
thank you mr kraft!!!!
Commentators are dressed as if they at a funeral. 
The Seahawks have the most penalties in the league. Clearly the league hates the Seahawks.
I think confirmation bias is real and opposing fans tend to notice when calls go to the Pats, and not the opposite
Jacksonville has a much better QB lol
https://mobile.twitter.com/PFF_Sam/status/955188757753421824
That was wrong too. 
Holy shit, the whattaboutism is real. 
"You go raise millions of dollars. 

Someone will give you an award."
I agree. After seeing the replay it definitely didn't look intentional. However, the flag still has to be thrown.
What cheating, be specific 
Yeah. I can't stop myself. I have poor self control. I just feel the need to defend the team you know?
Can't believe we are down by 4. Jags controlled the first half. We had almost no pressure on Bortles. And their defense shut us down. Hope we come out with a different defensive look to stop that goddamn RPO they're running. Run, play action, screen one side, or fake that and QB scramble. 
Those are the suite seats. Huge indoor section people are in for halftime
yes
Iâ€™m talking about hits and slaps after the tackle. It happened a couple of times in the first half 
I was born, raised in, and still live in Massachusetts you dumb fuck
I mean, if they are gonna bitch about fair calls, we might as well get the cheap ones too lol
"Yes those are box seats that clear out while everyone runs in to piss and buy 70 dollar bud lights.

In the cold games you'll see those be empty too because they stay inside the boxes"
Beginning of the fourth when the Pats have the lead most of those morons will have left
you forgot about "NFL= rigged" comments
Not if he's pushed out.  If he's pushed out, he can come back in and touch the ball.
Who the fuck is Grant and why is he uncoverable?
Basic cable television is so trash. 
You hate the patriots more than you like your own team? That's disgraceful.
Either crying in /r/patriots or laughing in /r/nfl, hey at least I'm honest
Yeah it's the refs fault that the Jags head hunted. 
Who the fuck is Grant and why is he uncoverable?
Yes
Which he did
It's gonna get spicy
The game thread is terrible as it is.
Hi
Then why not push every reciever out of bounds every play then? Lmao
"Dirty hit on Gronk. Let us win for him
"
Let's go D! Shut them down!
You say that but fournette is scary still. And the defense if chippy is still good.
I'm listening to the Westwood call while at work, and I gotta be honest it sounds like the better team is winning right now. This defense is gonna be pretty shaky when Patricia's gone
How much you think that helmet to helmet on gronk is worth in a paycheck bonus?
As is tradition. 
Gronk died for our defenseâ€™s sins, and through his sacrifice, angry Tom Brady will win this game.
What's a computer?
Watch the game, they are also smiling and talking to the Jags too. This happens in every game on both sides : |
"Oh no, I don't mean to be arrogant.

I'm just saying, you guys are like the 2012 Ravens, with an eventual win in sight. But I do feel some bullshit calls are coming our way to make it close, I'm just not sure what calls they will be.

I don't mean to be an ass."
Where have you been the last two weeks? Some people are going as far as suggesting Robert Kraft is paying the officials
How much does Mara pay to get a women beater a slap on the wrist while other teams lose their players for ever? 
Shit that sucks, where you at? 
Russell Wilson goes through the protocol in between 2 plays, Gronk takes 30 minutes. ruhroh
"Update on r/patriots. Its burning.

My own fans calling for me to swallow a bullett and calling me a fake fan... been subbed for a year and know we will win.

I fully understand the hate Pats fans get. It is well deserved. Never thought I'd be calling Pats fans pieces of shit, but here we are."
You don't see us going out and saying others are cheating? Why the fuck are you claiming we are based on zero proof besides the fact that a few calls go our way. Were the Seahawks cheating when the Fail Mary happened? No, that was an awful call. Jfc. Just because a bad call helped the Patriots doesn't mean we pay off the refs.
I agree with you, it wasnâ€™t dirty, just poor trajectory. Full stop. Penalty was spot on. No hate, bro.
When the Jets get a franchise QB
Targeting Gronk because they know they can't beat us straight up.  Ugly team. 
People say that during every game thread lol
Hi.
He literally PUSHED him out of bounds
$$$$
Cooks was like 10 yards past the los when Brady threw the ball. The rode him out of bounds for 30 yards and never played the ball while cooks was trying to come back I side. That's why he was so far away and that's why its pi.
Ok. Now no one can dispute the PI call.
Yes.
"Terrible call"
/r/ NFL is now a sub full of referees
Cleveland. They'll throw him a boatload of money that's gonna make the contract look bad almost instantaneously.
They're agitated because every post from a Pat fan is getting downvoted to 30 in seconds and people are claiming the game is rigged
He looks great wtf lol
Yep
Yes
Omg here at go again with the flat dump offs
didn't he raised a shit ton of money
"Non Pats fan: ""NFL is so fucking rigged, teams have to play the Pats and the refs."" 

(Keeps watching religiously every Sunday, Monday and Thursday. Spends hundred if not thousands on NFL gear, channels/streaming services and tickets/food and drinks going to the game)."
You gonna be okay? 
If you're from MN, have you ever had a proper lobster roll? 
Whatchoo dranking, Steelerbro?
Rose colored glasses 
I agree now that I've seen it again. 
Yep.
Dude, let those kids get paid.
C'mon man, fuck that dirty shit.
Six million people watched A Man with a Plan recently. I have yet to meet anyone who watches this show, but people are.
I'd love to see an angle down the sideline on the PI, that would be a lot clearer than the cross field replays we had.
I'm more annoyed by the celebrating after the head to head.
CBS has 60 Minutes though, right? Other than that, I agree. I can't stand to watch one more fucking commercial for the unfunny misogynistic circlejerk that is The Big Bang Theory.
Lol lifted shoulder pad. 
Apparently you don't know how defenseless receiver rules work.
Thank you
lmao
Fuckin refs helping the cheatriots out again!!! 
It's not up to them there is a league doctor that does it
Well I mean, it was a joke.
He couldnâ€™t get to the ball because he was being wrapped up lmao
Gotta be happy with the run defence so far
Can our defense go a single play without leaving a guy open by 20 yards?
Everyone calling for the replay of the delay of game: there you are. 
B-listers will probably end up being generous
They did a couple years ago or so. Each playoff game had two posts.
Questionable to return
Only a 15 yard penalty for knocking our best player out of the game with a targeted helmet to helmet hit, and Iâ€™ve had Dolphins and Bills fans telling me the fix is in for calling it at all. 
No its JJ 
Well thought out and comprehensive rebuttal. 
Fournette is like, a way better Blount.
I agree, was just poking fun at the guy 
JT I think
Questionable to return.
Did we like only practice run defense jesus
We all know already. 
Dirty Hits - 87
I didn't know a forum could be alive
Because they win a lot?
Headshots and people looking for controversy do that.  
"> What year did they start calling helmet to helmet?

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+year+did+they+start+calling+helmet+to+helmet%3F"
Lol call yourselves Americaâ€™s team again
No
They had a time out before it, that's terrible to have a delay of game. All blame on the Jags
What about that no-call on the blatant personal foul in the endzone after the play was dead and #44 was still mauling James White?
tallahassee without question. 
Gronks done. Guy didnt know where he was.
NE is not running the ball, they need to do that, or at least try harder, to keep the time of possession close
Yeah, we're all watching him play right now.
I'm assuming there should be a /s in there. God I hope so
I want him to go full frontal nude
Ya I think if it was any other WR other than Cooks the Pats don't get that PI because it wouldn't be catchable. Cooks is fast enough where I could see him making around the ball's area if he wasn't pushed out. 
What? Hating on Ben isn't racist you fool.  Remember that time he raped a college girl in a bathroom and was never punished.?
Bortles gets WAY to much time in the pocket 
Bortles with a 131.77 Passer rating jeez 
Dah Dah Dah by the Blue Oyster Cult. Youre Welcome - Maui. 
To be fair, Young Sheldon is pretty good as Ziggy in Big Little Lies. 
"Still in the locker room being evaluated.

I'm not optimistic, he was clearly wobbly. If he comes back it'd be more evidence of the protocol being a joke."
great stop there
Yes keep handing it off 
Fucking refs catching TDs for us again
They're still testing him is what i gathered. They don't know if he has one yet. 
I'll admit Cooks was doing some shoving, but the defender was manhandling him out of bounds for ten yards preceding that.
Absolutely fucking pathetic defense once again..
So what exactly is your definition of pass interference?
Holdingville Jaguars
Classic Pats defense. I don't remember the last time we had a solid third down defense. 
Why do the jags even waste roster spots with wide receivers
It's a friendly rivalry, man. Telling a player to fuck off after being sent off the field for a possible concussion is low. Have some class.
The refs are handing this game to the jags lol
Huge first down for Jags there. The athleticism of these receivers is incredible. 
Goddamnit. 
I think if he hasn't come back out after the half then he isn't making it back out today. 
"JOSIE'S ON A VACATION FAR AWAY  
COME AROUND AND TALK IT OVER  
SO MANY THINGS THAT I WANT TO SAY  
YOU KNOW I LIKE MY GIRLS A LITTLE BIT OLDER "
God damnit we are getting bortled
Don't be surprised if he comes back. The NFL concussion protocol is a joke.
3rd down defense is atrocious.
Second game in a row the pats PA guy has played LCD Soundsystem. I think both were Daft Punk Is Playing In My House
Stop being so modest. You *are* a doctor
Cam is down. :(
Damn that was a good play
Amazing 
Hope Robinson is ok. Hate injuries 
Goddamn we can't stop any of these fucking throws to these RBs from turning into 10+ yards.
Holy shit Bortles. 
Why do NFL players always go for the legs that's why so many first downs are picked up. What ever happened to just wrapping up and tackling. 
What bothers me the most is that Church was clearly celebrating on the play he took out Gronk, which they quickly cut away from. No one would celebrate taking a 15 yard penalty, so he could only be celebrating taking him out.
Yeah, because some little shitbag was holding him and got what he deserved
Fucking hell defense.
Get well soon 
Yeah. It was super nice. Never got backed up. 
Defense already looking better, Fournette's not getting 6 yards every run anymore.
HAHAHA
He is a cyborg now
felt that way too. 
lol
False. 
Burfict would like a word
Word.
I'm glad some third party fans are being rational here
ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
"Couldnâ€™t hear what they said about Gronk, whatâ€™s the status?

Edit: Questionable "
It really is working well
If we were the Seahawks, he'd already be back out there. Unfortunately, if the Pats did that, Brady would be suspended indefinitely. 
Why do the jags even bother running. Bortles can't miss his receivers right now
Yea it sucks hope hes ok for the superbowl if we make it
And what the ref saw fwiw
If he wasn't forced out it would have been
They know they're just spewing bullshit
Lmao
But... Burfict and Suh still exist
Maybe stop claiming the refs give us everything and well be less defensive
To your first point, I agree. To your second, fuck you with hot rusty nails.
I hate that every CBS show is a marine, or a Navy seal, or army hero who finds a nuke in the back of a van and saves America. Goddamn 
Coming from a Cowboys fan. That's hilarious 
Every thread with the Patriots is so toxic
"""shut down""

""decapitated"""
Helmet to helmet. Definition of dirty in 2018.
DAMN! great conversion on that 3rd though. shit!
I disagree.  He didnt even turn around then gave him a little push out of bounds.  Cant do that. 
Jacksonville is dominating both offensive and defensive lines...
Whatâ€™s been going on over there?
Everyone smart
Woah man pump the brakes. dirtiest player in the league? Like ahead of Burfect? Ahead of Suh? I mean he had a fucking dumbass dirty play don't get me wrong...but you can't possibly believe he is the dirtiest in the league
This thread gave me autism
Did anyone defend Gronk? Church hit where he could. unfortunately, wasn't much to hit except his head. Still a penalty. 
Yeah all you have to do is give him a concussion, simple clean stuff
Rocket scientist needs to hype it up 
the salt that this will produce
Bortles really showing up, fear another Flacco situation.
I could care less about downvotes. Let the hate flow
I don't think so. No reason to hoard shit you're not certain you want.
they can't since the run game is going nowhere
Hope Robinson's good
Both flags were the correct call, the helmet to helmet was obvious, and you can force a receiver out of bounds. 
Dude! Remember when we took Welker! That shit mustove hurt!
This progressive commercial is straight cringe
RIP groin
Because Patriots is my guess
Damn we need a thread for non-faded teams holy shit.
Yeah, sorry about that. We will learn more from this thread, and just shout RIGGED! PAYED OFF REFS! over and over into the void.
Mods, we may need a 2nd half thread now. This one seems to be getting bogged down and laggy.
Join
Yea but they only need one down dump it into the flat for a 20 yard  gain
Yeah, sure, let's just shut up in a thread about our team. Go ahead and take over for us, Cowboys fan.
Thatâ€™s pretty impressive hyperbole. 
Another 3rd down. Another horrendous play by one of our LBs. 
Pats just cant stop these dropoffs god damn. Cannot give up a td here...
Yeah. Utter bullshit. Church should be ejected. 
What about when our defensive captain and one of the top linebackers in the league is back
Losers.
Good ear
It's not like he's Keuchly with a history of concussions.
I'm so happy they found the time to squeeze in more commercials.
Literally me every week this season.
good guy Broncos fan right here. 
"How you doing fellow kids?

-- the box"
EDP
They wanna go for the sportscenter worthy highlight 
I'm speaking to the fact you said "we were doing so well" 
Doug Marrone was a class act, but #42 and #44 should each have a strike towards ejection for blatant personal fouls. Fortunately for the Jags they ignored James White getting mauled after the play was dead 
NFL concussion protocol would have let JFK back in the parade
I can't think of the last time we had a defense good enough to win a Super Bowl! /s
A rocket scientist can't figure out the ball is going to a running back every play?
Questionable currently. 
That's an awesome idea. 
He broke his forearm a few years ago. Never took it off after that
Questionable to return
Questionable
Nah, he's a pats player. Fuck him. 
There's a bunch in /r/nflstreams
"If your corners can't cover the Jags depleted WR core without safety help, leaving the underneath wide open, then you shouldn't have signed Gilmore to a big contact or even consider resigning Butler.

RBs and FBs cathing the ball without a defender within 15 yards is stupid."
"Eeeeey, found the piece of shit Jags fan!

Don't worry, we won't judge an entire fan base off of you being a dick. "
You think we're bad now? Just wait until Brady and BB retire.
You're actually delusional 
They need to put something in place to eject those players. Blatant head hunting
Our D-Line is also terrible so you may still be fine.
Yup, not much pressure at all. 
Questionable 
Against our defense it would lol. Guaranteed conversion on 3rd downs 
Can't deny that Bortles is balling out right now. Hell of a game.
Why do I even peek into this thread.  Soooooo many Patriots haters circle jerking.
">@Gronk ~~chop~~ replace that shit ~~off~~ and get back in there

He's Franken Gronk at this point remember?"
The commercial with him saying he keeps washing his hands after hugging a girl would see him become the ultimate fedora guy in 10 years if he was a real kid lol
But honestly, is that a difference from normal Gronk? Im pretty sure he gets his mom to take him to the weight room and then the club and then the stadium and then back home. 
He's that bad?
"""Lawrence Gay.""

His name is Guy."
This defense is a fucking joke
Lol quoting that record is a straight troll
Itâ€™s Lawrence GUY Jim.
I thought he got resigned for a couple years.
Did he just call Lawrence Guy "Lawrence Gay"?
Yeah, I have to agree. CFB refs are inconsistent about it but it's too important for player safety to ignore.
Let's not let this game thread get out of control
He signed a two year extension. Don't forget he is donta's backup
They had already announced the penalty.
Illuminati confirmed
Alright you can come too.
The independent neurologist always looks at players under concussion protocol. 
We don't know how to tackle
Lol given that we are outnumbered, we have to do our best :)
You're literally using a throwaway account because you know you're trolling us. Fuck off. 
"What fucking blind eye? So because of a dirty hit, the refs should have allowed that?

The fact that you are happy for an injury is absolutely pathetic. No one is defending gronks hit months ago. Am I never allowed to root for gronk ever again? How can you root for the jags after any of their dirty hits in the past?"
Fucking blowssssss
Come on Chung. Need those tackles.
"Because your weak ass take is

>Sucks about Gronk. He hasn't done much but disappoint today anyways. Three drops and gets no seperation. Nothing but a very important decoy today. Need him for that at least.

You didn't even know he has a catch for 21 yards."
CBS sure is proud of its shitty shows. 
I'm actually sad for you. Protip: If you ever have the opportunity, get the buttered lobster roll. Way better than that mayo & lobster garbage. 
Lawrence Gay, lolll
you will miss the Patriots when the ride is over
Damn fournette, nice move
https://gfycat.com/YellowPitifulBarnacle
Those aren't even close to the same things. 
How do you tackle that spin

Turkey Romo???
Can we stop a third down?
Wrong sub
we need a stop plz
"""chung was ready to deck him""

i don't think chungy could deck fournette with a running start."
"I expect Young Sheldon to make a comeback this ~~period~~ half

edit: still in hockey mode oops"
Ok, so now its ok to celebrate serious injuries, good to know.
"You clearly know nothing about the Irsay rule or NFL history. Fuck off and learn about why your team was able to get even one super bowl with Peyton.

Fucking embarrassing yourself."
Bolololo - Tony Romo
Gronk status?
We have our first Romo Turkey noise for the evening
Stop going for the fucking legs just wait wrap and wait for your team mates to help tackle. Fuck sake 
Oh. It was overflowing. But huge threads of 20k plus comments mess with Reddit servers. The thread wonâ€™t always update immediately, and itâ€™s hard to respond to anyone. That didnâ€™t happen with the CFB championship game. Smooth sailing the whole night. 
nope
"It's just general brand awareness. Reminding people IBM is active and relevant. 

"
lawernce gay?
All ~~seacawk fans~~ of the NFL hopped on the nuts of Jacksonville so fast.
Can't stop Bortles lol
If you "dominated" a half and you are only up by 4 and you are going against Tom Fucking Brady, you might be in for a hard time 
The fuck is wrong with you?
Finally a 3rd down play!
Flower Power
"Wait we can stop a 3rd down?!.

That's legal?!?!"
Not enough for my liking, it's better but still worried
3rd down miracles do happen
Big stop
OMG refs swatted that pass!
OMG the defense did something on 3rd down.
This sub is utterly deranged when it comes to the Pats
It's...it's beautiful
It's because there's a ton of commercial related comments and that's to no fault of the redditors. There's simply just too many commercials during the f'ing game!
We got a stop on 3rd down!!
Well worded! 
Perfect deflection

Jesus what the fuck is wrong with so many people being happy with gronk getting hurt?
Nice play Flowers!
Having the time of his life somewhere most likely
And neither did I. You implied they shouldnâ€™t have been called cuz â€œthatâ€™s footballâ€. I disagreed.
Yep. I must be pretty far behind cuz I just saw it 
He does a lot of voice work. He is also on Archer. Also was on SNL.
It is like all conspiracies theories. Once you want to find proof of something, everything becomes proof. No logic or reason can convince them otherwise.
Most punchable faces: Verizon guy
He's not going to. 
Romo is awesome. Thanks for the passion.
I think this thread and last week with the Titans are some of the worst threads ive seen in this sub..
A book.
iT WaS tHe ReFs
Fuck, Iâ€™m salty, but that was honestly a great kick 
No one is mocking Amy Winehouse. 
The Jags' long drives made it impossible to cut to commercial as much as they wanted in the 1st half. They're definitely going to make up for that.
Occasionally, but his insights into formations and what not are completely worth it. 
that's how I felt!
The rules state the player is allowed to reestablish himself afterwards, bc the play isnâ€™t called dead but the penalty is called. Itâ€™s basically a free play. They either get the catch and gain more yards or get the penalty. 
So if it clearly showed Bouye pushing him sideways with his handa that's not a penalty to you? Because it sure looked line he might have.
To be fair, that may have been the case before.
"Richard Sherman on the Gronk hit;

Believe it or not, George isn't at home.
Fuck the worst superbowl ever seen in the NFL's 52 years of superbowls.
lol
That's right after the ref didn't call a late slam on White after the whistle, right?
If any Pats DB did what was done on either of those calls and didn't get a flag, anti-Pats social media would complain to no end.

I could have gone the rest of my life without seeing Tony Romo's balls.
Endlessly bitching about calls is playing the victim.
Yeah. I donâ€™t trust any reddit book recommendations after that. So bad. 
There are a couple people that root for evil.
Tony Romo wants to get paid!
Chipotle dude
Shit part is we canâ€™t use the no Gronk excuse because we won an entire super bowl without his services... gonna have to dig deep for this one. 
"I noticed this thread was getting a little divisive so I brought us some bagel bites

I thought if you got pushed out you could come back in? Or am I wrong?
This is going to be very hard without Gronk

Yes.
Umm... how is it not the people complaining about the calls who are "crying"?
I saw some Titans fans cheering for us. Other than that, probably not. I'd be cheering for the Jags against anyone else.
whiny
That's Romo. 
It's more "80s nostalgia: The Movie"
Needs more bolded words
This place is doing the same thing lmao.
Haha this sounds like the elderly throwing out buzzwords related to technology
bortles vs foles? its bad for ratings
Why?
How? Because he has had literally one single dirty play in his career? And besides, rooting for injury is just stupid. When Gronk slammed onto White it's not like I was happy even though he had been holding gronk most of the game
Man, Romo even has insight about injury treatment. Dude is such a good announcer. 
I like him a lot in Silicon Valley, it sucks that these commercials make him out to be so unlikeable.
I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever seen a nation obsess over a single hand before
tony's balls!!!!
He clearly thought it was players from different teams getting into a tiff, realized his mistake after trying to get in to break it up, and laughed about it...
S H I F T Y
Cmon Pats, tie this thing up.
Game could come down to a dirty hit on Gronk. NFL seriously needs to do something about head hunting
little apple girl, by far
It might be a bit (overthrows to Gronk and Hogan earlier)
Someone tricked Bortles into thinking itâ€™s the fourth quarter and his team is down 27 points since the divisional round
Gooch and hand close up. Nice.
Fucking unbelievable that you can knockout a guy like that and it only costs you 15 yards. Should be an ejection like in college 
Jacksonville defense are some dirty fuckers 
I like the book a lot. If you have any love for 80's culture I'm sure at the least you'll enjoy it as a nostalgia trip.
Dion you too little to be talking shit.
Looked like it would have been god from 60. Damn
Lmao no flag?
Titleist is made closeby.
/NoContext
THE REFS THOUGH!!
Cooks without fail good up asking for a flag
Jags D bad sportsmanship. Let's clean it up.
THE HAND 
Holding his arm no flag aight...
My opinion that you didn't ask for: you can go either way. But, any AFCS rivals that are rooting for the Jags are bad people
that throw was actually gorgeous 
Bouye holding his arm the whole way
Thatâ€™s 100% Pi
He hooked the arm, should be PI
Fucking cooks man
Oh man you gotta catch that 
Fuck! That was in your hands, Cooks!
I'm talking NFL kickers.. :)
Well thatâ€™s frustrating. 
God Dammit Brandin
No, see, thatâ€™s okay.
Just go hurry up jags canâ€™t handle it
Wake up Cooks
Well he was holding the arm down
Damn. That could have been a td
Canâ€™t wait for the conspiracy theories about what was happening on the zoom in shots of Bradyâ€™s hand being worked on
Fucking hell man. Cooks has so much speed but his hands are so mediocre.
So many drops c'mon.
Every game he drops one of these. Fuck.
Possible concussion 
Yeah, that's how football works.
Is that not a hold
Cooks needs to come down with that!
magic?
Even though it was right in his breadbasket donâ€™t they still call it? I mean he couldnâ€™t even get an arm up to catch it haha 
Cooks has to catch these 
that hold tho. 
I want a replay on Hogan's ball spin. 
"> Mastisol

Sounds like a steroid to me..."
Hate when the ball hits me in the hands.....
Cooooks noooooooo
If Cooks had better hands he'd be a Julio-level receiver.
cooks is really fucking us over right now 
Dammit Cooks
Lmao I got downvoted for saying bouye grabbed his arm, which he fucking did
COOOOKS! DAMN YOU!
Can't drop that
Michael Thomas > Cooks
Ooooooooo Cooks. 
Thatâ€™s a td cooks. Fuck
But I thought the game was rigged and the Pats were getting all the calls?
Said no one ever.
Texas
Wtf cooks :'(
cooks just can't bring those deep balls in
#staywoke
Another perfect throw,  another drop.
I meam, if they can get them, why not?
The cooks experiment isn't as bad as the Ochocinco one but it's not very great.
THREE DROPS SO FAR NOOOO
Wes Welker v2
His hand was held...
How do you drop that? That's the third perfect throw dropped tonight. Jesus. Brady can't throw and catch the damn ball! Gisele told us that. 
I love when defenders start talking shit when they had nothing to do with the dropped pass
DAMNIT COOKS
We'll need to crunch the numbers on that one, but I think it might check out.
I see 80s schlock, I upvote.
Thanks for that insight John Madden
"You're happy for an injury? At least you admit it you God damn trash. 

You heard it here folks. /u/lsu_baw_89 is happy when players get hurt. "
Near Dallas 
Fuck cooks bumass
So why isnâ€™t the player who threw the helmet to helmet hit out of the game If gronk is? Kinda disgusting you can lay a blatant dirty hit and have no repercussion other than a 15 yard penalty. 
yeah no flag there but obvious PI ... sigh. yeah good shit, Definitly fixed game /s
Would have been a TD
Still under observation, likely out for game 
Cooks omg
Take a shot every time Romo says chunk
No it'd be pretty stupid to say
The guy jumped up and hit his helmet inadvertantly. He hit back. Jags d has been doing worse all game
Hogan's ball spin is on point.
great 3rd down conversion 
Damn it Cooks, make a play!
Brandon â€œLaFellâ€ Cooks
This game is going way too slow...........
Dion is mouthy today
North dude, axis of the earth
Cooks has soft hands. Every single game he drops a huge play.
Dude was beat by two steps and was talking shit lol
"I'm following this shit via this thread, driving in a cramped ass van going from Pitalito, Colombia to Nieva to board a shitty tiny plane, and I'm screaming and irritable and everyone in the car is scared including the driver who doesn't speak English.  

I can't do this. "
Lol
I'm convinced they have that in their playbook with how often it works out for them. 
It's funny to see a jets fan talking about culture 
i do that when i play defense
Well Ramsey was holding his arm down.
Maybe because him arm was held down?
Cooks' inconsistency is maddening
Gotta catch that...
I doubt the Broncos will improve too much before next season. It all depends on whether Jon Gruden can get the Raiders into shape and how you guys perform against the Chiefs.
Hmm I wouldn't say disappointment, wasn't really expecting an All-Pro WR, a let down tho? yeah?
Is bouye gonna commit PI every play?
They threw 2 flags. Go watch a replay. 
Why the screen
Shitty playcall again.
mariota woulda caught that, come on cooks!
gahhh!!
Holding his arm down isn't PI?
what a gross playcall 
Because the jags playcalling got conservative once they had a lead
What kind of play call was that?
These little dump offs are not working
Kinda hard seeing him get a contract next year. 
What the fuck was that play call McDaniels!?
Maybe not the greatest play call of all time
Cooks reply blew it that drive
Whyyy would White leave his feet there, runnnn
Quit getting cute josh, the fuck
Ask Atlanta how that worked for them
Except it wasnâ€™t. It was helmet to helmet. 
...what?
Omg the punter did the head thing. Wasn't that a false start?
Stay safe man. 
HEY I DONT THINK THESE FUCKING SCREEN PASSES ARE WORKING MCDANIELS YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE
We really have to pick it up on one side of the ball out the other, or Jags have this
Is that why youâ€™re a healthy scratch for the game today?? :P
"Damn it. Try to pin them within the ten.

Edit: Ok, I will accept the 10."
Goddamn Cooks.
Stop. Dropping. The. Fucking. Ball. 
No GRONK and no Edelman is killing us. Best receiver right now is who? Hogan? Dola? Tough agaisnt this defense 
Pls no more 3rd down screens
Cooks is such a fucking frustrating player. He has skill, but is inconsistent and NEVER fights for the ball. 
fucking cooks man HAVE to make those plays
Cooks drop was the difference between a possible TD and a punt that drive. McDaniels is doing a great job to scheme him open, but Cookie just has to make those plays.
Does Cooks not know how to jump?
"He didnt look for the ball either
"
Brady, you're so damn dramatic LOL
Just pointing out that refs aren't exactly giving everything to NE
God damnit Cook. How the hell do you drop that ball. Just killed the whole drive. 
I love how we didnâ€™t give up 30 points to the jags.
Not officially yet...but I'm not getting my hopes up for him returning. 
Less deep shots we need to get those 1st downss
Not officially, but unofficially, yeah he's definitely done dude.
Cooks is a bum
MY LIFE! I WILL GIVE MY LIFE! LOL stfu
yep... prolly why we got him from NO
hm, not sure about that call
Go watch a replay.  That might help you out. 
Stop doing these short fucking passes jesus christ
Great playcalling josh...
The Pats playcalling on third down is maddening. The Jags D is so fast and these little dump offs on third just aren't going to work. 
I'm so sick of watching cooks drop these long passes that hit him in the hands. Brady is doing his job, do your's. 
He still keeps in contact and helps take care of the son. Their families are close. 
I disagree. He might not be top 10 but hes alright. He normally has a good play or two a game.
"Welcome to the dystopian cyberpunk future

Facebook is the evil corporation in your favorite sci-fi story "
Anhueser Busch is going to milk dilly dilly for at least another year
flowers just ate fournette on that rush 
When is the last time a screen pass actually translated into substantial yards? Maybe we shoot rip them all out of our playbook.
Biiiiiig stand
Really consistent all season, but that was huge
Lets gooooooo
He is retired. This is what he does for retirement.
Fournette got decked on that sack holy hell
LET'S FUCKING GO
Fournette got destroyed 
LETSSSS GO BOYS!!!!!
lol are you serious?
Its crazy that Cooks put up the numbers he did this year with all the drops. Those numbers woulda been insane if he was consistent.
Pats have made their adjustments!
oh no
Here we go let's get some points now! 
Biiiiiig stand 
You guys see Fournette get rocked on that sack?
Good stop!
Good our defense needs the rest
And there is lifeeeeeee
Wow thereâ€™s a momentum swing.
Jesus they made that look easy
Nice 3 and out 
New England defense finally looks like they know what the score is.
Letâ€™s block this punt!
did we just get a three and out???
Pats legend James Harrison
Lmao white flag offense
Field position
Let it happen...
"I'm calling it right now:

The Eagles will win and the commercial after the game will say ""Philly Philly"""
#WE EATIN
Finally. Good job D.
Ha! 
Eh I randomly picked the Pats when I lived in Georgia. It was a very bad decision.. until it wasn't. 
Under 1.5. It's the SB, they'll have other commercials 
"No Gronk. No Edelman.

Save us Brady."
Mods didn't split the thread, let's get to 100k
Where are the haters to tell us how the refs caused that 3 and out!
Second half adjustments!
I love Patricia, it's gonna be really sad to see him leave.
YES! Great sack!
woah our defense is back?!?!? cautiously optimistic 
Finally a big stop.
i hope the wizard betrays the king, turns him into bud light, fucks the queen and then turns her into bud light as well
Despite his play, Jaguars not trusting Bortles at all. Didn't let him throw before half-time, didn't let him throw there.
Lol Fournette got blown up on the blitz pickup. Great job by the defense
Thus far defensive adjustments have been good. Now to go to get a TD.
someone tell red hoodie in the stands to make some noise on third down.
woken
They did lose their second best character
Pats getting a lot of pressure now
Doubtful.  Maybe the butter or milk?
Truer words have never been spoken
All the money in the world can't buy fashion sense
lol no. They're good and they can pull away with this but 2012 Ravens were a buzzsaw, we were never in that game. 
Probably giving him some brain water and avocado 
wouldn't have it any other way
Idk why but I read this as you didn't want to leave bed and miss the game so you were gonna poop in your bed 
It wasn't a commercial for Facebook. It's a video series Facebook is doing that they chose to use as a commercial. 
Wtf  is this noise in the turbo tax commercial?
Why the fuck is that Marlin squealing?
come on big stops there
What's bigger...Harrison's arms or Fournette's thighs?
It's like video channels. They have sort of shows from people and other content providers.
"@ you
"
Flowers just killed a man 
That's some real salt
I mean your head is more important than your legs so 
What just happened!
At least his taxes are free. Classic.
***R O C K E T  S C I E N T I S T***
Turbotax just stop pls
What the fuck was that turbotax commercial
You should see the pic without the beard, looks weird 
i love my pats brothers, but man this joke is getting oldddddddd
The fish?
Need 7. Come on. Cooks, no more bad drops plz.
he has pet termites
Wheres Fournette?
Stfu dude
Pats have 22 rushing yards. Guess if we win this, we do it on the arm of Brady again.
Wtf was that commercial I'm not doing TurboTax the fuck 
The jaguars doing the trash talk after every play reminds me of the bad guys in every football movie.
sAlT
Just go down Dola. Can't lose you too
At least 4
And an ointment made from the ashes of Jimmy Garoppolos contract extension
I blame Ben macadoo for the overabundance of commercials
"Your mistake is thinking Pats fans follow college football. 

Speaking as a rare example of one who does. Trying to get my friends to watch with me is a chore. "
">SWAT is a good show dont @ me

@/u/thebigpink you're right, very well done"
Same. Pretty scary 
Does verizon only have one ad out on the market wtf...
Iâ€™m at the library and see all these fucks here with pats jsersy but ainâ€™t even watching the game fuck u
Gillette Stadium logo
can a swordfish actually go through a person like that? I feel like the pointy part would break off
Dude Diggs! What a catch?!
Won the super bowl without him last year
unfortunate, because he's been playing pretty solidly today
It's strange because they were so ballsy last week vs the Steelers. We'll see down the stretch in the 4th quarter.
They did it all last post season. 
https://media.giphy.com/media/kRWFIgO75okHm/giphy.gif
Or the Mighty Ducks :D
I don't know that a sledgehammer would hold up against Gronk's big ol' noggin
That fish commercial is fire TBH.
We're the bad guys. Never forget that.
BUY TRX, plz it needs a pump 
Make a facebook post or an ESPN article about it then.
it's a tower/walkway built into Gillette Stadium. the stadium where the Patriots play.
So what are the inedible fish with higher mercury content?
Sex with him would probably be very robotic
Low risk play where you're not likely to get the first down
We've been severely underacheiving on both sides of the ball. I have no other explanation for the way this team has played
Sorry about your sister.
Wasnâ€™t malicious, but still illegal. 
He gets pretty pumped up. 
Saw the big screen earlier say "WAVE YOUR TOWELS!". Haven't seen anyone with a towel 
Fuck Alabama 
True. Should have taken the shot to get sacked for a safety here
god damnit
I think it's supposed to be the fish?
It's the lighthouse and bridge that make up one corner of the stadium.  Took me like five years to figure that out.  
Would be a good golf partner, never losing the score pencil
It doesnâ€™t if you do it yourself. 
"""Pats are cheaters and refs help them win...""

""...PLEASE GIVE US JIMMY! PLEASE GIVE US YOUR COORDINATORS!"" "
Will be a shame if the Pats do lose him in the offseason.
That was an awesome change, and I hope the adjustments are going to work, but there is still a lot of game to play. 
Why did I fall for that
Why do I always click these things
(No . . . . I'm making a reference to the most overplayed commercial in the playoffs.)
The Good Wife was very Good. Even won an emmy for the lead actress.
the guy in the fishing chair looks a bit like fat nelson cruz
Jesus Christ Pats get a fucking first.
Win or lose, our performance this game has been straight up embarrassing
Wow we fucking wasted that didnt we
Also, their stream right now is minutes behind the actual game. 
Lakers and Dolphins are on opposite coasts
He ain't wrong
Jags defense is good
Man, Brady needs to put more on those passes to the flats. Jaguars D is too fast to lob it out there softly. 
I can't tell if people saying to go for it are way ahead of me or way behind me
this defense is just fucking clamps
Nice playcalling Josh
"Can we PLEASE stop throwing behind the line to gain on 3rd down?

Jags are too fast and too good at swarming to the ball for this. "
mannn we gave you the 28-3 game, why u gotta root against us man!!
Because he's brought us too much success, or?
a turnover here would be nice
"fucking throw that shit beyond the stick

dont be afraid"
Always shilling 
What were those calls!?
Seriously why are we not going for it at all.
Nice playcalling Josh
Lewis needs to top going backwards after every catch/move...
No gronk hurts our offense a bit, this 3 and out shit is not gonna win us this game
"""GUESS WHAT DEFENSE IS RATED #1 IN CALL QUALITY?""

""Dude, the D is sticking out""
"
I really wanted them to go for it there.
Dirty as shit, but good.
Why the fuck would you punt that?? 
Do you have something against white people?
McDaniels we have to actually score points to win. 
This year....last year
No Gronk is also a big loss.
So many throws before the sticks in short yardage. 
Also, water is wet
because most of the people on these game threads dont actually watch football
What in the fuck was that playcalling
People say this but Brady is one progressing threw his reads and checking down.  Sometimes there's just nothing else there.
It's funny that the jaguars are a type of cat because this game is also a cat because we have it in the fuckin bag! 
Dion is a freaking spider monkey but stop throwing to him short!
Lets take as little time off the clock as possible, give our defense no rest and give them the ball back, good plan?
Patriots are not going to win the game with this play calling 
I feel like Bortles is doing well though? 
We can't be throwing behind the first with short passes on third down. Jags are too quick to it
God damnit McDaniels. Can we get a real playcall?
Sure did.
we should not be in hurry-up right now. why rush to get your defense back on the field?
Use absolute zero and its free for both
We are in trouble. Eventually these injuries were going to add up and now losing gronk I think is too much
Okay, Washington crossing the Delaware Turnpike was pretty good.
We are running out of people who can get open down field. 
What a waste.   Why have conservative playcalling when behind
Without GRONK the offense is stagnant 
McDaniels loves these HB passes right at the line which aren't working and Brady is playing great when dropping back
Drafting top five for years.
McDaniels plz
Great timing by Westbrook.
This was our game to lose, and itâ€™s still our game to lose.
Shit 3rd down D coming.
Right? Gilletteâ€™s music coordinator always plays Alice In Chains haha, I love it 
Stop cutting to Patricia looking defeated after our defense blows it and gives up huge chunk plays. The Lions could still change their minds
you can just feel it coming
For everyone bitching about the Jags running into the line over and over, why do you think the play action passes keep working?
Dropped balls are losing us this game
Stop! 
YES
Because they only have a 3 point lead with 6+ minutes to go.
Hey, I have Pats flair! Downvote away haters!
Let's go great d boys!!!!+
Salt
Fuck yeah!!!!
Bortles whining right now 
You mean the hold?
Not that itâ€™s the same, but he plays Madden by reading the defense, and then audibling on the line. Dude has a massive football IQ. 
Game over baby
Hurns been really good against us. :thumbs:
Jake Jortles.
Within 5 yards of the LOS.
This is an amazing game! 
For what? There was nothing there
Do ya thang Brady
Yup!
Except that was a completely different play where he was held back for like 10 yards and pushed out of play 
FYI, that's what PI looks like.
Pats fans should leave this thread right now. The hate is palpable.
Ramsey who?
Lol that was obvious PI
Oh boy, here comes some salt....
DAAAAAAA REEEFFFFFFFFFSSSSS
hErE cOmE tHe ReFs
Keep pouring me that salt 
Thanks Ramsey
Here comes more salt!
##ITS A PENALTY YOU FUCKS
The old Joe Flacco method strikes again
Gonna argue that PI?
Came here just for the comments
Only way Jags can play D is holding and PI 
PI
Grabs him around the neck. Yeah DPI.
That one is unquestionably PI
JAGS GOTTA STOP w/ THE DUMB SHIT
Right call. 
If somebody complains against THAT.
Someone try and tell me that wasn't PI
DPI YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKERS
that was obvious PI now, come on guys.
Oh boy.  Truckload of salt incoming
Lol Iâ€™m for good calls
facts
Soo I'm guessing that is a bullshit PI as well??
Def pass interference. He grabbed him by the neck lmao
Thatâ€™s obvious lol
"Clearly not a catchable pass, how could that be pass interference?

/s"
You have to call that 
Great call
Didn't you know? Only the Pats get calls. 
"Sit the fuck down Ramsey. Trash as hell

Stephon Gilmore >>>> Ramsey"
Ramsey getting burned. Bad switch 
Clear PI, but no the refs are definitely in their pockets.
Please, someone tell me how that wasnâ€™t PI?
There's literally zero argument that's DPI. 
aaaand the salt is back.
Entire game thread is Pats fans rooting for their team and Jags rooting for their team, and every other fan bitching about refs. I like the Jags a little more now.
Someone tell me that wasn't DPI. I DARE YOU 
Tryna choke him out lol
Move Those Chains!
Lmao now choke holds are legal to you losers
I <3 YOU REFS
Good call
Is that bullshit too? Did he go for the ball? Did he have a time machine or some quantum touch?
That was obvious
Thatâ€™s a flag
Judging by this thread, let me guess, that wasn't a foul and the patriots bought the refs.
Good flag
Clear Dpi 
He had him a headlock. That would be PI
Cue the bitching by 31 other fanbases. 
This is late but why did they call that fumble recovery dead. 
Welcome to a Patriots thread, where the first three quarters are cancer and the last 5 minutes are gold. 
In before whining about the flag when cooks was in a headlock.  
Bring on the salt
in before people think that shouldn't be a penalty.
I'm sure that call will be controversial lmao. Clearest PI of all time
Ramsay sucks. 
Grab em by the ~~pussy~~ neck 
Stop complaining guys. 
Really? Gonna complain about that blatant PI call?
but CAN win without Gronk =)
we got that play from Baltimore's playbook 
He litterally grabbed him by the neck
You Eagles fans complain a LOT about the refs, Jesus. Itâ€™s not even your game
Everyone is so salty
WTF CHEATRIOTS ALWAYS GET THE CALLS
Wrong shoulder
Yeah tell me that is a biased call haters
This call was correct
alot of salty bois
Alright alright skol for me 
easy ass call 
Can't wrap your arm around his head
of all the calls for people to complain about.. that one isnt your best bet
â€œHow are they going to call a flag when Ramsey pulls him down before ball gets thereâ€ nfl subreddit bitches
LOL, no.  Ramsey had his arm wrapped around the receiver's neck well before the ball got there.
Tbf, I was 19 when I got a great big Pat Patriot tattoo on my arm. Whatever they do these days, I look like a bigger bellend than usual if I cheer for anyone else. 
How can you argue thatâ€™s not PI? Lmao
Whole arm around cooks neck. Yeah.. bullshit.
I guess
lol cry more
Not even going to lie we win most of our games on big penalties. Our 12th man is the penalty flag lmao. 
Ugh 
Don't see why everyone is losing their shit. It was a good and correct call.
that was definitely flag worthy.
If Jax holds NE to three points after the DPI, that would be amazing. 
BS PI welfare calls for the Pats.
Trying to argue that wasn't a PI? 
"I MEAN I KNOW IT WAS A PENALTY BUT PATRIOTS" - Salty fucks
Good call there. All of you will say it's rigged tho. Fuck off.
You really don't think that was PI?
Yeah Iâ€™m rooting for the Vikings now. Well said 
That was the first penalty by either team this half. Also that was the easiest PI Iâ€™ve ever seen, lol. Whine more
The flag or the headlock?  The predictable downvotes make it hard to tell.
So they could confirm he grabbed Cooks around the neck before he had a chance to try for the catch?
Well try to pin them here. This game isnt easy...
This thread is what happens when two separate circle jerks come together in a Venn diagram
Why aren't we running crossing routes?
Holding by the helmet and dragging him down isn't PI? 
did you not see the PI?
I agree, I dont like it either.  I wish they did a 15 from yard of scrimmage, but what do I know Im a pats fan 
Force the 3 and out
take off your anti-pats glasses. He was grabbed around the nexk
Do you really want the shittiest super bowl in Jags v. Eagles?
Yeah but did you see the guys jersey? He was a pats player, it has to be the refs helping out man
They may be right about Pats getting away with some PI (it was kinda both ways though) but choke slamming someone has to be called.
 Where were you when everyone was claiming the game was over in the second quarter?
Ryan "how about right at the ten" Allen.
That was the first penalty on either team this half according to the TV
D still overdue for a turnover. 
No bro
He had his arm around his neck before the ball got there. Crying like a bitch. Clean it up.
QQ the refs 
Of course they are.
That was legit PI on Ramsey 
If the refs were favoring the refs wouldn't that have been DPi
Tebucky jones is my dude. Reason i wore 34 for sports
Keep it classy Indy
Who cares, if he's grabbing a guy's helmet?
Jags have to make a play on the ball, not the player. 
Good call

His hand was around his neck what game are you watching???
Yeah this thread is toxic. LOL
DON'T YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT MANNIGHAM
It's a shame that's the best insult you can come up with.
seriously are people mad about THAT dpi?
S A L T
Wish Gronk didn't get decapitated on some bullshit late hit
Cmon d. 3 and out. Gotta help us out here.
The crying about the refs is reaching levels of crybaby I've never seen before.  Stop whining you cackle of bitches
haha it's going just like i said.
Just in: coach who talks incessantly about special teams has great special teams players
Wow, all pro-Patriots comments are downvoted
"This whole thread is just three comments saying the refs are rigged against us, separated by one completely neutral fan going â€œhey, I totally hate the Pats but that was actually a totally legit call.â€

Maybe theyâ€™re all actually legit and yâ€™all just hate us SO much ðŸ¤”"
So what does coughlin actually do for the jaguars? I see that heâ€™s not wearing a headset
Those 2 and 7's are turning into 2 and 11
Not gonna lie...I'm nervous as fuck right now
all right, we need a fast stop here
Because BB is the coach 
THE ROWESEN ONE
ROWE ROWE ROWE YOUR BOATS
did you miss that entire TD drive?
The first half of the super bowl wasn't that long ago
One more time defense. Just need to hold them to a fg. 1. more. stop.
Nice block 
Keep the pressure up on Bortles 
What
It must be fun ignoring blatant penalties just so you can shit on your least favourite team.
Jags defense = hey we're  gonna commit some dpi ok
Joe Sacco sitting right here with me on the couch helped me come up with it! ;)
Chris Simms may be right. but it doesn't even matter. 
How's that not a block below the waist on Fournette?
Anything here besides a td is fine. 3 to and 2 minute warning.
josh mcdaniels can't out coach todd haley makes you think
I feel sick... Like, actually sick...
Chewie is kind of a klutz and doesn't have any sword skills. The mountain is a psychopathic montster.
Lol...must have stolen the ravens playbook this week. God you're dumb 
oh man, here's where the jags blow it
How is that not block in the back?
DEBO!
Because he had his arms wrapped around his neck before the ball got there? 
Harrison!!
DEBO HARRISON
Where was this defense in the fucking first half
BORTLES GONNA BORT
REFS WITH A GREAT DEFENSIVE STAND 
LETS GO PATS 
That's the Bortles I want to see
That's fair. 
pats have been doing a decent job in the second half against the run.
Eric Rowe really is the weirdest player to watch. There's Eric Rowe, who plays like shit, and then there's 4th Quarter Rowe, who turns into the second coming of Deion Sanders.
Thanks for Harrison Steelers 
Patriots legend, James Harrison. 
What a dart!
James Harrison GOAT signing
I don`t know how this game ends... but i'll need a drink after this
"Holy shit tight throw.  Thought that was picked for sure
"

No thanks

I hope jack is ok!
He's gonna roll to the endzone
HMMMM URRRR OHHHH ERRRR AHHHHHH
Never touched the ground no worries!
Amenâ›ªï¸
Romo makes the weirdest noises on every catch lmao
Romos sound effects are getting annoying
Did he flip that up into his hands so it didn't touch grass as he was falling? AMAZING!
lol "those were good sound effects, but there was nothing there."
Ohhh ah eeee ooh
Shut up romo
"Some good sound effects" - Nantz taking the piss out of Romo now.
Never touched the ground
Tony Romo loves making those noises haha
Lol he just rolled until they touched him
Talk to me buddy. Im not even nervous buddy. We have this. 
"Ah that sucks that Jack is hurt

Fuck injuries"
Amendrolla
Danny boy!!
I'm high and nervous. This isn't a good feeling.
"injury" timeout 
Fake injury 
Strong rolling awareness.
What a throw and catch
I thought that got picked for a second and almost threw up
No. Fair catch signal is when you wave your hand over your head.
Oh no! Get up Jack! 
That's a catch
I've only been this nervous once before 
No, his hands stayed very low the whole time.  
That's not a catch..
OH NO MUH KARMAS SAD
Yeah, but you know, money is finite
Glad that Romo's bullshit was called put.
DO A BARREL ROLL FOR EXTRA YARDS
as soon as lewis lost the ball. Belichick lost faith in him
Hoo boy that is an Edelman like catch
I don't think that's a catch. Need the end zone angle again though.
Brady has been picking on Miles Jack all quarter, and it's worked so far
BRADY BRADY BRADY BRADY
That's a catch 
WHAT A CATCH
Dolas like the clutch welker
Nothing like a fake injury to slow the momentum down.
Never hit the ground?
Romo should do every game. 
Okay, how long before someone clips together all of Romo's odd reaction sounds into one video?
I â¤ï¸ Amendola 
Some fucker just sat down. haha. 
Oh my god, we are going to win lol
How are you going to feel when we win this game?
"oooooooh uuuhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhh" - Tony Romo, 2018
Jack went down so the Jags could review this catch. Good idea there.
Home. 
It is almost as if the jags are a young undisplined team and the pats are specifically coached to minimize penalties 
This guy just sits down after the play. What a dirty fucking team 
Edelmanâ€™s Super Bowl catch esk
Amazing throw
Romo sounds effects right on cue
Ground didnâ€™t aid in securing it 
Why don't defensive players fake an injury on close plays so the offense can't quick snap to prevent a challenge.
He was never touched, doesn't need to retain control.
Commercial gate?
100% thought that was a pick
definitely gave me a good chuckle 
Romo making noise like he read that comment here last week...
Catch, and Jack is not faking injury.
Romo out there moaning like Tina Belcher
Amendola is having a huge game.
Haha no it didnt
Jarret Jack being a bitch... Just stopping the clock
He wasnâ€™t touched.
Im furiously swapping between here and Google away from a tv
They gave Dola the rolling yards. Can't recall seeing someone advance by rolling before.
Tf romo doing
Thatâ€™s clearly a catch guys lol
Damn; never want to see injuries.
Bless the knees
No weight bearing :( you don't wanna see that regardless of your team
"stop tony, you're killing me!
"
What a great time for my cat to start puking everywhere...
Don't wanna see Myles Jack get hurt. He's been so good today
Danny plays MgsV confirmed 
Miles jack injury would fuck up the jags D a bit
me too
Holy shit Iâ€™m so nervous right now. What a good game. 
DICKS OUT FOR DOLA
This Miles Jack injury...
Jacksonville's speed focused defense will hurt them here, late in the game as fatigue sets in. Same situation we saw in the super bowl. Just need the defense to hold.
That
That might not be a catch.  Timely injury
"momentum injury lol

looks real, my bad."
Now THAT's how you catch a ball and roll a couple of yards.
Yikes! You never want to see that. 
Damn, he's not putting any weight on that leg. I didn't see what happened, but that's not good. :(
You mean the one with contact within 5 yards of the LOS? Possible DPI, certainly not definitional like the other one. But we'll obviously agree to disagree. 
I want Amendola's hands cast in gold, studded with diamonds, and put into the Hall. 
Miles Jack just sitting on command. 
Big, if true
that's a catch, or it might not have been, but one of those
you know, maybe the pats took that away?  
I need a Tony Romo soundboard. The sounds he makes are hilarious. 
Hope Myles is okay. :-/
That sucks, hope Jack is okay
"lmao at people saying it touched the ground. so clear in the replay it didnt
"
How the fuck did he do that!!!!!!!!!!!
That's not fake, he's hurt man. Be classy
We've eliminated it it was only a matter of time until Bill figured it out
"About the pass interference call on Ramsey, by definition he committed DPI. Please just ignore my flair and read the rules and rewatch the play, Ramsey committed DPI. Can we please stop crafting a â€œrefs are shitâ€ narrative in every thread?


http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/passinterference"
Amendola rolling on the ground to try to get more yards since he wasn't sure if he'd been touched lol.
yikes. jack's loss is big. NE has been doing well w/o gronk, dola is literally doing 150% out here.
Jack down could be huge
I take back every bad thing Iâ€™ve said about Danny
Thank you Dan Fouts
lmao we are fucking unbeatable 
Is this gonna go into overtime? 
You win some, you lose some. The fumble, for example, could've been gone either way but it was called a fumble on the field and there wasn't evidence to overturn it. Overall the calls have been even. 
I can't believe the refs gave us such great field position
Oh shit Myles :( 
Tony RoMoan
You just start watching the Pats in the past year?
It was textbook PI...idk what else would make it worse 
GOAT SNEAK 
Only if I don't wear my glasses.  
BRADY WANTS THIS!
Catch. Ball never touched the ground.
Ball never touched the ground
I love Romo, but the one fault he has as an announcer is her tries to turn non controversial calls onto controversial ones
Quiet please, offense at work.
Sneaky
Romo is out of control and itâ€™s hilarious
The best/weirdest part of listening to a Romo broadcast is the random noises he uses to fill in time or stall. I personally love it (for now at least).
James White really bout that life
They are at the moment. The Pats are on the Jag 10 with Football Jesus as their QB. The Jag offense has also stalled. 
Ball didn't even touch the ground though, like, at all...?
pop that ankle back into place doc! 
Fuck hope Myles is ok never want to see an injury like that :/
Or Edelman, people forget how much he means to us,  im sure you don't. I'm sorry, I'm not sorry
That is not good for Jax, 44 has played out of his mind today.  Hope he is ok
"I never once doubted us.


I never once doubted our ability to endure the refs, to endure the bias.


When Gronk went down, I stood up and haven't sat down since. 


I never doubted who the champions were. "
Fuck Blake Bortles. Tom Brady is the best running QB in the game.
How was that not a catch?? The ball literally never hit the ground...
"Don't like jack leaving the field like this :/

Dude has been fun to watch and playing lights out.
"
BRADY SNEAK
Romo with the oohs and aahs! lmao
Yeah and he's gotten the ball on a couple too
Fuck that busted hand.  Dives right into 1000 pounds of linemen
Myles Jack maybe it was maybe it wasn't a fumble 
Win or lose, all I want is one Pats game without questionable calls favoring us where we get a solid win 
Bad injury luck here.
Everybody is dying
No they have not. Show me one that they got away with, come on. I'll wait. 
Sucks to see Jack going off like that, dude is a hell of a player.
nonono not Myles Jack
Last year Bill made him carry a football around all day at practice and had everyone else on the team try to knock it out of his hands. Then in a press conference said something like, "Now that's ball security... right, Dion?" Savage.
didn't touch the ground that's a catch
Surprised they didn't review that.. didn't look like he survived the ground
Jaguars dropping like flies oh my lord
Yupp gotta wish him nothing but the best
BRADY SNEAK
Jaguars defenders are dropping like flies. They gassed. 
Now Darius is down! 
My stream is a little behind, but who's the announcer that keeps making these amazing noises?
Brady knocked out Darius
Everyone stay Healthy please
Jaguars going down left and right. 
The "Not Todd Haley" special 
Jags defense is just worn out. 
2 yard sneak. Holy shit. Whereâ€™s Ben last week?
Christ Solder
Regardless of whatever anyone says about the rest of the game, brady's throws are fucking on point today.
Was that a two yard Brady sneak!?
"That's not a catch!" - No one on the Jacksonville sideline
Holy shit what a push. 
The similarity between the commentary of Romo and Gary Neville in soccer is getting ridiculous. Both very good with the analytical side and now Romo is making random noises too like Nevilleâ€™s orgasm in the Chelsea-Barca game. 
But it didn't even touch the ground, like, at all...
Damnit I HATE injuries!
Jags going down faster than soccer players 
Only extra points
They're dropping like flies
Yâ€™all ainâ€™t ready. 
2 yards QB sneak makes my peepee hard
Every play fall to ground to slow momentum
Please, no matter who wins, protect the knees and ankles.
More flops than soccer.
Understandable have a nice day 
I love Romo I don't know what you guys are complaining about.
Hate to see Jack go out like that
WHERES YOUR TODD HALEY NOW
Tom Brady > honey badger.  Tom Brady don't give a shit.
Sucks Jack got hurt. He's had one hell of a game.
"H A N D C A M

SNEAKY TOM STEALIN FIRST DOWNS STEALIN YO GIRL
Waving off the punt isn't a fair catch
Whoa gimme a minute to read this
Oh man Darius limping too.
Holy shit that's really not good for the Jags. Jesus 
Fucking clutch Brady is the best.
What is this, the Flop Bowl?
Please put POz in 
Really, really don't want Jack to be injured. One of my all time favorite NCAA players.
Wasn't Lewis touching when he got the recovery?
Brady running through water
WHY YOU HEF TO BE MAD?  IS JUST GAME!
Another injury
Another free time out
2nd and 2, 2-yard sneak... Sure, why not
He wasn't down by contact.
Jags going down as fast as their chances at reaching the SB
Ditto. Figured it was time to look at and potentially contest the catch
Humans are such stupid fucking animals. Half the people in this thread sure it didnt touch the ground, other half sure it did. Any theory based on man being a rational actor should be murdered and set fire to.
Keep down voting losers
He's not down until he gets touched.
Faster they score the better. If youâ€™re gonna leave time on the clock, Iâ€™d rather have the option of getting the stop or them scoring while having the 2min on my side. 
I am having fun
Will you feel small and petty?
i don't follow jags all that much but it seems like he gives up or resigns himself to losing after a certain point
Dude stop
...wat
4th quarter tom brady is just a different species 
Not Dareus too
Jags defenders are dropping like flies
WHat did? The ball certainly didn't!
i'm thinking run it left on first down, don't call time out, and then a quick slant with two wideouts to the right on second down
Hope Myles is ok
Regardless of who we root for or our opinions of how a game has gone we can all agree FUCK INJURIES
Shut up you loved it
Man I love game threads
No, I think there's some Texans fans on the bandwagon. But they're the only ones.
"He literally had his arm around the receivers neck before the ball got there. It wasnâ€™t even bang bang.

Go cry more"
Run up the gut with Dareus out?
How are you defending them DPIs bro. Jesus its blatant.
Because he doesn't want it to be, duh.
never good to see injuries let alone back to back ones
Jack and Dareus, that sucks
no pick or fumble please man
Brady QB sneaking??? I like that!
Fuck injuries. 
no matter what happens. jags need to get a better QB next year and they'll be unstoppable
TOM HAD SURGERY ON HIS RIGHT HAND TO STUFF HIS FIST UP A JAGUAR BUTT
It's happened to every team. Hell, they blew a play dead I think two or Three seasons ago where Brady passed to a wide open gronk with no one I front of him, 99 percent chance at a td, no one knows why it was blown dead. 
It's almost like they try really hard every snap
Why are no timeouts being taken from jags, or time ticking?
Hopes Jack and Darius are alright. Theyâ€™ve been great today.
hate to see the jax d getting hurt. dont wanna win on injuries.
Talk about dropping like flies. Shitty when in goalline.
beautiful sneak
Buffalo Jacksonville was close, not good
Jax faking injuries to slow the game down.  They know this is when the Pats go to no-huddle hurry up.
found the communist
Sure I want the pats to win but I do not want Jags players to get hurt like this.
Yes it fucking was!!!
Please protect the ball.  please...
Okay I went for a piss when Jax got the ball and now we have the ball near the end zone. What?
The bose of the football touched the ground 
Why would you QB sneak one of the biggest QBs in the league? 
i normally love him but he's grunting and making noises way too much this game.
Beginning of the end, boys. 
Jags being soft as fuck with these injuries.
"> 40 year old QB sneaks

> nose tackle is injured

what"
because Jack was treated for injury
i love those quick TB12 sneaks
Thatâ€™s a catch bro
"brady is qb sneaking at age 40.
"
This is bullshit get him off the field.
Glad to see this guy walking
uh oh, people dropping like flies. Not good.
Never hit the ground. 
"It's a catch. He had his hand under the ball and was not aided by the ground, nor did the ball come loose.

Seriously the catch rules aren't this complicated man. They're pretty straightforward. I don't get how anyone gets it wrong anymore."
Ah, ok sorry I wasnâ€™t sure. 
Yea that's shitty
nah, Ben is too small /s
Why has Jacksonville not been penalized two timeouts for these injury timeouts?
Incoming "Pats have to injure opposing players to win" comments
Romo 
Amendolas gotten better every year. When he first got to NE he was mediocre. But now he's pretty close to edleman
I don't know how the Jags blew this, but I'll take it!
That's hilarious, thank you!
New jag dying every play...
"Tom coughlin is in the building 

*tom"
Rob Gronkowskiâ€™s spirit sends his regards 
Jags take out Gronk and then all of the Jags start dropping like flies
Yep. Thatâ€™s totally it. You know me, pal. 
Keep regurgitating that tired excuse
injuries suck
PLIABILITY
Should we throw it? 
Thanks
He used to be a shithead on the Bills.
"Let's go pats
"
Probably got told to tone it down a bit
These injuries suck.
Here come the downvotes but 100% correct 
Only if after the 2 minute warning
Clearly didn't, and is entirely the reason the Jags didn't challenge it... they even had extra time to decide cause of injury
Just Blake Bortles 75 yards for the win right?
It's not that God hates the Jags, it's that he loves the Patriots.
they think he's faking
Factual statement here. No need to blame the refs if you keeping tossing it to grant, who was a lock for 15 yards everytime he touched it
Losing Gronk was lucky?
Romo
Live Footage of Tony Romo in the Booth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqId-NoqpZ0
I just realized Gronk was out
Wondering how r/NFL feels about these obvious fake injuries to stop the clock....
It's called being good
Wasn't touched
Yea, idk if it's technically a block in the back becuase he wasn't really blocking, but thought it was questionable. 
Letâ€™s go! 
Say what you want but an old man with a busted hand just qb sneaked for a few yards and a first down. That's fucking awesome.
Refs did it.
lol just spam that on everything.
i thought that was after the 2 min warning?
I mean you guys have recent superbowl wins. Plus living in Denver I never hear the end of it.
fuck i hope myles jack is ok, just a game at the end of the day
I miss red zone Gronk
Ok
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT OK. 
Tom Brady with the QB sneak. One of the best at it, I feel like he always gets the first
Losers make excuses.  It's just fun watching all this salt. 
Haha. yeah. 
It's almost like the Jags D has been shitty and boisterous all game and emotions are running high, even for fans.
Touchdown Tommy!!!!
Yes.  1
TB12 made of steel confirmed
So far so good
How fucking far away is your bathroom?
DOLA
How about instead of insinuating, consider they are, Idk, chanting the name of the home qb whos on the field right now?
DOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
DAAAANNNNNYYYYYYY
Sodium is bad for your heart.
"He would if he saw any.

If he disagrees with a call he says so, we saw it in the past two games.

He's agreed with the refs on pretty much every call this game."
nantz giving the td already wtf
Dola!!!!!!!!!! Again
Time to buy a Dola jersey? Perhaps...
What in the world are you talking about?
Ahhhhhhhh FUCKING DOLA
Think that's only under 2 minutes
DOLA GETTIN IT DONE

RIP THEIR HEARTS OUT BRADY! HOLD IT TOGETHER DEFENSE
There's still time 
Still 3 minutes left. Not calling it just yet.
Whereâ€™s Ramsey lol
Game isnâ€™t over *returns to edge of seat*
Bbbbbut the refs
oh hello yall
He was waving off his own team, not signaling for a fair catch.

Did you guys see the refs just catch that ball?????
SECRET WEAPON
**DANNY AMENDOLA CAN FUCK MY PARROT**
Brady is god.
Don't think you're giving our D enough credit. Bortles has played really well this game. 
AMENDOLA ROCK AND ROLLA
What a fuckin dart!
I agree, thatâ€™s just in poor taste by the fans at foxborough.
Amendola is the clutchest patriot of all time 
gg ez
Amendola is a god damn hero
Will this be the death of Blake the man and the rise of Bortles the legend? 
Bless all the players and keep them healthy. 
When their O has done nothing for the entire quarter? Trust me the DID NOT want that.
Amendola plz fck my bitch (and me) 
If it's any consolation, once Brady retires the Pats will be irrelevant for the next 10 years probably.
Belichek going wild
lots of time left
Danny "playoff" Amendola!
Bill doesnt give a fuck
No Gronk, no Edelman, no Problem!
"Bellichick ecstatic"
Wow
It's really true. They had good calls the players just couldn't execute. 
Danny Amendola is my fucking hero.

He just threw a TD.
Is amendola the secret weapon this game? **WELL? IS HE?**

Idk why r/nfl and the Patriot haters do this to themselves every year 
I've gained a TON of respect for the Jaguars this season.  They're an amazing team.
The fact that you dont realize the difference between the two situations is pathetic salt.
Good throw and catch by the refs there. Fuckin fix man
Come on defense please. Bend, don't break whatever. Just one more drive.
Riggate
"ahhhhhh yes. i just jizzed. so hard

Never heard that term before but it's amazing! 
Bellichick still ainâ€™t pleased.
Not over, not with our defense.
LOL "Belichick going wild"
Yes there is. He just threw a Touchdown.
"So glad Kraft remembered to send around the community pot to pay off the refs. It only came in 2 days ago so I was worried we wouldnâ€™t be able to get it to them in time. 

Good call to go with the â€œ10% less holding callsâ€ this time."
Playoff Dola
I admire your honesty. 
Okay Bortles.  If you come back and complete the comeback, nobody will ever have the moral latitude to utter the phrase "Bortles sucks" ever again.
Bortles is gonna have to rip some passes and then rip some cigs 
Was worried Ghost would miss that.
Amendola's always been clutch.
Playoff Amendola
Need someone to pick up gritty, shitty, bust-your-ass yards? Better find Danny fucking Amendola
If Bortles gets a TD on this drive, he should no longer be shat on for any reason whatsoever. 
Can't wait for Minnesota 
Vikings, go Keenum!
10 stitches in hand, still fist bumps literally entire team after a play.

You shut your mouth. 
You hate to see that happen to a team like all of the rest of America

I didn't even know. Thank you ðŸ˜Š
Ore wa ~~Gundam~~ Tom Brady!
I'm not that confident. Bortles has the ultimate in meme magic on his side.
oh fuck defense please help us god
Jack is sitting on a cart out for that drive... not sure how that would help them more than a stopped clock
Agree. Fuck that noise
How can you hate Brady heâ€™s such a fucking beast we all are so lucky to witness him

Interesting to see what Patricia does here. You don't wanna be too soft and give out easy yards but you don't want to be too aggressive and give up a TD
Not a fair catch motion.  
Yeah that ref ran in there and secured the ball for Dola.
Time to see if bortles is for real.
Danny Playoff Amendola!!!!!
Lack of awareness 
Flake Bortles letâ€™s see what ya got 
"""Belichick Ecstatic""

pans to bill 's expressionless, motionless form. "
Patricia's HC interview starts right now. 
lots of time left... lets go defense!
AMENDOLA.
Amendola is so unbelievably clutch for a guy who doesn't up remarkable stats. 
Shut up loser
Danny Playoffs!!
Why? What exactly was rigged 
Nothing positive can be said about the Pats in this thread lol so sad man. 
Lots of time left. JAX has 3 TO as well
With 3 minutes left and 3 timeouts Jacksonville can still potentially run a couple times to keep NE honest. This could easily come down to a throw to the end zone.
Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but only heard clapping when he was getting helped off the field.
"AMENDOLA LETS GO

TOM BRADY THE GOAT"
Worth.
DOOOOOO FALLLLLLLLLL
Absolute zero is free, which proves my point.
I will never bitch about Amendola being over paid and over rated again 
Brady is, as expected, a fistbump guy now!
DANNY PLAYOFF
"lmao most people won't get the joke. 

Mia San Mia"
When Rodgers completes those hail mary passes, are those are gifts from TB12? 
Go pats
He's a scrappy player. A real gym rat.
I think Bill tells them to not risk it unless 4th down or 2Pt. Danny indeed had both hands down under the ball. Protecting it from the ground.
Come on hold em.
"And Belicheck going wild" -- Romo
I kill em, as soon as im done with all these birds 
Ok defense just needs to do their job 
Amendola is always so clutch
Jags have plenty of time to go back up the field and score a TD though. This drive will decide the game
Wanna ride Dola's dirty stache 
So it seems /r/NFL's hatred of the Patriots supersedes its love for Romo.
Gilmore has been great today 
RIP DOlores
Looks like the jags need to stop committing penalties. 
GOD I LOVE BEING A NEW ENGLANDER.  Still game left tho, lets FUCKING GO D YOU GOT THIS!
This game is not over. I wish felt as confident as everyone calling it. D needs to step the fuck up.
Good thing Jacksonville took that knee before halftime to avoid blowing a lead.
You saw that play and thought it was undeserving?
Jax has time, everyone chill and watch the game
Amendola, what a catch
I think we'll see a pick this drive 
maybe because NE is more disciplined... ever thought of that?
belichick has no emotions
Didn't even have to watch, just upvoted.
that is not a fair catch signal. 
Zombie is the perfect song for this thread.
"Thanks 

- Danny Amendola"
Always count on the Pats to make a comeback.
"Romo's a football fan. He's pumped to see Brady doing what Brady does best.

If Bortles pulls off a comeback here, Romo's going to mark out just as hard."
At first it was Blake "Tom Brady" Bortles vs Tom "Blake Bortles" Brady, but now it's Blake "Blake Bortles" Bortles vs Tom "Tom Brady" Brady
Every Superbowl the BB led Pats have been in has been a classic.
I've never been comfortable with Amendola using Troy Brown's number; but if this goes right I'm buying that jersey.
Ones where I say "Jeeeeeeeem" repeatedly 
Thereâ€™s a lot of football left but holy fucking shit!! Thatâ€™s my QB
Man, the nfl needs more wholesome interactions like this. Fuck me for being a Pats fan, but props for being able to look at this objectively.
Danny "secret weapon" Amendola
"do you think jax knows de way?
"
Yeah, If you don't commit as many penalties, you get less yards against you. Pretty easy tbh.
Ill take one 2001 season please
I would be okay with the jags winning this game. Pats got some luck to be ahead now 
Cheers! Enjoy!
he did, his teammate un-bortled it
Looks like Brady is gonna need surgery on his hand - to add an extra finger for that sixth ring.
ROWE LOST A SHOE
Was there a flag on the play?
"I was under the impression you don't get charged a timeout if you don't have any timeouts, but if you do, you do.

Bills or Vikings or someone suffered because of that."
The jags O isnt the falcons O .
Yo, Penguins are a scary team.
Holding you to this 
Rowe making the play with just one shoe on.
Gotta go for it here...
4th and 15.  4-down territory here?
He fucking tackled him with one shoe hahahaha 
At this point I'm expecting Dilly Dilly to be next #1 hit comedy on CBS.
Come on D, for the love of god stop them!
In all honesty, he's been looking like a great pickup since we got him. Really doing more than I think we could have expected even.
You guys let him go...how is he a trader?
You know what to do Duron. Do your job.
O shit going for it. Alright. 
That's fair.
Bortles CAN HE DO IT
"NFL told them to leave TB12 55 seconds.

Because this whole game is fixed, right? Swear I read that somewhere here. "
Ol' Tommy Ten Stitches
No, pretty sure they just made it up.
Jagaurs fans, regardless of the out come, I think we can all agree on one thing;  This game has taken 10 years off of all of our lives.
remindme! 1 hour!
Here we go!
Loose shoe 
oh man this is over unless jags can do something
EVERYTHING IS THE REFS FAULT! 
Lol.  In the hospital on a remotely monitored O2/heart rate monitor.  Nurse came Rushing in after the Dola TD and Bortles sack.  My heart rate shot up
What were those flags?
Bortles run
I mean have you been reading this thread?

GILMORE IS MY FATHER 
I'm on a delay (streaming), but don't lose hope. Your whole team is legit. I thought Bortles was a joke (loveable still), but he's not a weak point. 
NICE GILMORE
What a great play.  That may have been a TD if he didn't get it. 
And that's why Gilmore got paidddd
Hey haters remember earlier Iâ€™m the game when you counted out the GOAT ???? Howâ€™s that working out ??

That's what the Jags get for drafting an NBA player for the NFL.
GG Jax
"Dilly Dilly.. business as usual.
"
Any patriots fan confident that Gilmore makes that play is a liarrrr
My favorite play all game. 
Yea he kills me.
THIS IS MY LAST RESORT
Eh, we were getting hate after 2003. Like, anyone who believes in Deflategate is just grasping at straws.
Gilmore is my friend again
ENJOY. THE. SHOW.

"Gilmore sucks!" fuck all y'all! 
He just said "GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE"
GG
Best defensive play all year 
Right in time :)
WHAT A PLAY BY GILMORE
Beautiful play from Gilmore. 
He's making the plays of 2.5 receivers today
I never understood why people latched on to such a forced corporate catch phrase in the first place.
Gilmore just earned every penny. 
GILLY GILLY!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a fucking play
Bortles is shortarming almost every throw.
Great defense by New England, and I didn't think I'd hear myself say that at any point of the game back in the first quarter.
Gillmore just earned his pay check. 
GILLMORE WITH THE SUPERMAN 
GILMORE YOU GANGSTA!!!
Stephon "SUPERMAN" Gilmore 
"But Gilmore sucks!

- The Narrative RIP (2017-2018)"
What a fucking play by Gilmore!
